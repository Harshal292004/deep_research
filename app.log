### Key Insight Summary
The current status of American tariffs is complex and multifaceted, involving various types of tariffs, historical developments, and ongoing negotiations. Tariffs are taxes on imported goods and services, used for protection, revenue, and political leverage. The American tariff system has evolved significantly, with recent changes including tariffs imposed by the Trump administration and ongoing trade tensions with countries like China. Current tariff rates vary by product and country of origin, affecting goods such as steel, aluminum, solar panels, and numerous Chinese products.

### Final Thoughts
Understanding the current status of American tariffs is crucial for businesses, policymakers, and individuals due to their impact on trade, economy, and global relations. The tariffs reflect a mix of economic, political, and strategic considerations, aiming to protect domestic industries and influence international trade dynamics. As the global trade landscape continues to evolve, the implications of these tariffs will be significant, affecting not only the United States but also its trading partners and the global economy.

### Implications
The current American tariffs have far-reaching implications across various sectors and countries. For the United States, these tariffs are intended to bolster domestic manufacturing and reduce trade deficits. However, they also risk triggering retaliatory measures from affected countries, potentially leading to trade wars and economic instability. The ongoing negotiations, such as the US-China trade talks, are critical in determining the future trajectory of American trade policy and the global trade environment. As the Biden administration continues to shape its trade agenda, the future of American tariffs will likely involve a balance between protecting domestic interests and fostering international cooperation to promote stable and beneficial trade relations.[0m

The implications of these tariffs extend beyond the United States, affecting global supply chains, trade balances, and economic growth. As the United States navigates its trade relationships and adjusts its tariff policies, it is crucial to consider the potential impacts on domestic industries, consumer welfare, and international cooperation. The ongoing trade negotiations and potential future changes to American tariff policies will likely shape the course of global trade, underscores the need for continued monitoring and analysis of this critical aspect of international trade policy.[0m

[36m2025-05-04 16:35:47 | DEBUG    | Agent | exa_output type: <class 'list'> | Content: [ExaOutput(text='President Biden on Tuesday quadrupled tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles to 100 percent and imposed new levies on computer chips, solar cells and lithium-ion batteries in a bid to prevent a flood of low-cost Chinese products from swamping his hopes of reviving domestic manufacturing. Capping a three-year review, the president slapped tariffs on a modest $18 billion in Chinese products “to protect American workers and businesses,” especially in the auto industry, the White House said. Administration officials said the actions were a needed response to years of “unfair trade practices” by China, including forced technology transfer, intellectual property violations and hacking of American businesses, that have given it a dominant role in global manufacturing. “It’s not competition. It’s cheating,” the president said during a Rose Garden signing ceremony featuring representatives of labor unions and companies from the affected industries. Tuesday’s actions effectively made Chinese clean energy products much more expensive for American customers. But without tariff protection, domestic manufacturers would be unable to compete, leaving the United States dependent upon China for the bulk of what’s needed to transition to a low-carbon economy, administration officials said. To some analysts, the president’s tariff policy conflicts with his environmental goals. “If the Chinese government wants to subsidize American consumption of EVs, the best response is to welcome that foreign aid,” said Scott Lincicome, a trade specialist with the Cato Institute. “If climate change is an existential crisis, as the Biden administration says, that should be the No. 1 priority.” Almost a quarter-century after China formally entered the global trading system, however, U.S. patience with its economic system is exhausted. Generous state support, in the form of easy credit, free or low-cost land and workers with few rights, has enabled China to rise in one industry after another. “China is using the same playbook it has before to power its own growth at the expense of others by continuing to invest despite excess Chinese capacity and [by] flooding global markets with exports that are underpriced due to unfair practices,” said Lael Brainard, director of the White House National Economic Council. “China’s simply too big to play by its own rules.” Now the Biden administration wants to draw the line — and be seen drawing the line — at an industry that was identified with the United States for most of the 20th century. Though the Chinese EV threat for now is embryonic, administration officials and independent analysts say the competitive challenge will only grow. Last year, Chinese car companies exported just $400 million worth of electric vehicles to the United States; sales by European manufacturers were almost 20 times higher, according to Oxford Economics. “This is all about stopping the flood before it begins,” said Michael Dunne, an auto industry consultant based in San Diego who spent several years in China. Along with erecting new defenses around the domestic EV market, Biden on Tuesday also doubled the existing tariff on basic or “legacy” semiconductors to 50 percent; more than tripled the tariff on some steel and aluminum products to 25 percent; and imposed a new 25 percent tariff on the giant ship-to-shore cranes used to unload container ships at U.S. ports. Some of the new levies, such as the semiconductor fee, will take effect next year, while others, like those on surgical gloves, will not hit until 2026. While the administration insisted that politics played no role in the decision, White House officials also repeatedly distinguished between Biden’s actions Tuesday and the policies followed by his predecessor and likely opponent in November. Former president Donald Trump, beginning in 2018, imposed tariffs on roughly two-thirds of Chinese imports. He is campaigning now on a pledge to levy a new 60 percent tariff on all Chinese products, a move that many economists say would disrupt global supply chains and increase inflation. Biden officials, in contrast, describe the latest tariffs as “carefully targeted” to protect only the strategic sectors that the president seeks to cultivate: advanced computer chips, low-carbon energy and key industrial materials such as steel and aluminum. Nearly $1.5 trillion of public and private funds have been channeled into these industries in the past few years. While Biden criticized Trump’s tariffs during the 2020 campaign, he kept almost all of them in place once in office. On Tuesday, Ambassador Katherine Tai, his chief trade negotiator, confirmed that they would remain in effect, despite U.S. industry hopes that they would be narrowed. “We’re not going to let China flood our market,” the president said. The White House also blasted the trade deal with China that Trump signed in 2020, saying it failed to increase American exports or manufacturing jobs. U.S. factory employment has grown by 773,000 jobs since Biden took office. Six years after Trump first took aim at the fundamental elements of China’s economic system, a second president confronts the same problems and is again erecting trade barriers to address them. “It’s the correct response to a big problem that China is creating in its overproduction in key manufacturing sectors,” said Wendy Cutler, vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute, and a former U.S. trade negotiator. “China’s trying to export its overcapacity to the rest of the world.” The administration said the latest U.S. tariffs are designed “to encourage China to eliminate its unfair trade practices.” But some analysts said there is little chance of that happening. “If you don’t push back on Chinese subsidies, you lose your industry,” said Jeff Moon, a former U.S. trade negotiator. “This is not solvable. This is the nature of their system.” Indeed, heavy state subsidies allowed China in recent years to dominate global markets in shipbuilding, steel and solar panels. Now, its increasingly capable automakers threaten to vanquish the U.S. auto industry, which is struggling to manage a transition from gas-powered to electric vehicles. With a debt-ridden property market weighing on domestic demand, Chinese companies hope to survive by exporting their excess production to customers in the United States, Europe and developing markets. China’s auto industry can produce 40 million gas and electric vehicles each year. Domestic sales and exports total roughly 30 million. That leaves excess capacity of about 10 million vehicles, roughly equal to the number produced in the United States last year, according to Dunne. Dunne praised the administration action but said it was insufficient to guarantee that American car companies could survive. “Tariffs solve one half of the equation. The other half is how to ignite a mind-set of innovation, intensity and ambition among domestic automakers,” he said. More than a decade after Wen Jiabao, then Chinese prime minister, warned that China’s growth was “unbalanced, uncoordinated and unsustainable,” its leaders continue to prioritize manufacturing over greater consumer buying power. China spends more on industrial policies to shape its economy than it does on defense, said a 2022 report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. In dollar terms, China spends more than twice as much as the United States, according to the report, which was funded by the State Department. Continued investment in manufacturing capacity has left many Chinese industries able to produce far more than is needed at home. Biden administration officials complain that China now controls “70, 80, and even 90 percent of global production for the critical inputs” the U.S. economy needs. This year, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said Chinese companies would “demolish” their global rivals unless the United States and Europe erected new trade barriers. In Beijing, Wang Wenbin, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, accused the United States of “hyping up the so-called ‘overcapacity’ in China’s new energy sector” and said Biden’s tariffs would hurt the global effort to fight climate change. Any potential Chinese retaliation is likely to be limited, according to Greta Peisch, who stepped down this year as general counsel in the office of the U.S. Trade Representative and is now a partner at Wiley Rein. “This is pretty measured. We see China generally matching U.S. actions in scope and scale. So I’d expect their response to also be measured,” Peisch said. The tariffs reflect the challenges facing the Biden administration as it tries to balance global climate goals with geopolitical concerns about China’s dominance of EV supply chains. Biden wants half of new cars to be zero-emission by 2030. But EV sales growth has slowed in recent months, leaving the country far off track. The new tariffs will have little effect on domestic EV sales at the moment, analysts said. The only Chinese electric vehicle for sale in the United States now is made by Polestar, which is owned by China’s Zhejiang Geely Holding. But Volvo, which is owned by the same company, has been planning to introduce new electric models as soon as this summer. And U.S. tariffs could discourage Chinese automakers such as BYD and Nio from selling to American consumers, leaving fewer EV choices at dealerships nationwide in the future, said Corey Cantor, a senior associate for electric vehicles at BloombergNEF. “There’s kind of a paradox,” Cantor said. “There’s this element of getting more consumers into EVs. And then there’s this element of keeping out these attractive Chinese EVs or the U.S. auto market will be decimated.” News of the tariffs first surfaced last week while John D. Podesta, senior adviser to the president for international climate policy, was meeting with his Chinese counterpart in Washington. Podesta told reporters Friday that trade tensions between the United States and China — the world’s two biggest greenhouse gas emitters — would not undermine climate talks between the two superpowers. “Even as our overall relationship between our two countries has increasingly been characterized by fierce competition, we have an obligation to our citizens and the people of the world to communicate, cooperate and collaborate where we can to tackle the climate crisis,” Podesta said.', url='https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/05/14/biden-china-tariff-ev-solar/')][0m

Our business is managed through the following four business segments: production and precision agriculture (PPA), \nsmall agriculture and turf (SAT), construction and forestry (CF), and financial services (John Deere Financial or FS). \nBUSINESS SEGMENT \nPRODUCTION AND \nPRECISION \nAGRICULTURE \nSMALL \nAGRICULTURE \nAND TURF \nCONSTRUCTION \nAND FORESTRY \nFINANCIAL \nSERVICES \nPRODUCTS\n• Large and Certain \nMid-Size Tractors \n• Combines \n• Cotton Pickers and \nCotton Strippers \n• Sugarcane Harvesters \n• Sugarcane Loaders \n• Soil Preparation, \nTillage, Seeding, \nApplication, and Crop \nCare Equipment \n• Certain Mid-Size, \nUtility, and Compact \nUtility Tractors \n• Self-Propelled Forage \nHarvesters \n• Hay and Forage \nEquipment \n• Rotary Mowers \n• Utility Vehicles \n• Riding Lawn \nEquipment and \nCommercial Mowing \nEquipment \n• Golf Course Equipment \n• Backhoe Loaders \n• Crawler Dozers and \nLoaders \n• Skid Steers \n• Scraper Systems \n• Four-Wheel-Drive \nLoaders and Compact \nTrack Loaders \n• Excavators and Compact \nExcavators \n• Equipment used in \nTimber Harvesting \n• Road Building and Road \nRehabilitation \nEquipment \n• Articulated Dump Trucks \nand Motor Graders \n• Retail Notes \n• Revolving Charge \nAccounts \n• Wholesale Receivables \n• Leases \n• Extended Warranties \nCROPS/FUNCTION \n• Corn and Soy \n• Small Grain \n• Cotton \n• Sugarcane \n• Dairy and Livestock \n• Lawn and Property \nMaintenance \n• Golf Course \nMaintenance \n• High-Value Crops and \nSmall Acreage Crops \n• Earthmoving \n• Forestry \n• Roadbuilding \n• Financial Solutions \n3 \nSmart Industrial Operating Model and Leap Ambitions\nOur Smart Industrial Operating Model is based on the following three focus areas: \n1. Production Systems. A strategic alignment of products and solutions around our customers’ production systems. Production \nsystems refer to the series of steps our customers take to execute different tasks, operations, and projects to grow an \nagricultural product or execute a project. \n2. Technology Stack. Investments in technology, as well as research and development, that deliver intelligent solutions to our \ncustomers through hardware and devices, embedded software, connectivity, data platforms, and applications. The technology \nstack leverages these core technologies across the enterprise, including digital capabilities, automation and machine learning,\nautonomy, and alternative power technologies. The stack has the potential to unlock economic and sustainable value for \ncustomers by optimizing jobs, strengthening decision-making, and better connecting the steps of a production system. \n3. Lifecycle Solutions. The enterprise integration of our aftermarket and support capabilities to more effectively manage customer\nequipment, service, and technology needs across the full lifetime of a John Deere product, and with a specific lifecycle solution \nfocus on the ownership experience. This integrated support seeks to enhance customer value through proactive and reactive \nsupport, easy access to parts, value-add services, and precision upgrades, regardless of when a customer purchases our \nequipment. \nOur Leap Ambitions are a framework designed to boost economic value and sustainability for our customers. The Leap Ambitions set goals \nto measure the results of our Smart Industrial Operating Model. The ambitions align across our customers’ production systems, seeking to \noptimize their operations to deliver better outcomes with fewer resources. \nThe Leap Ambitions framework has three components: (i) size the incremental market opportunity, quantifying the value that can be \ncreated; (ii) identify the key actions required to guide investment in digitalization, autonomy, automation, and alternative power \ntechnologies; and (iii) define the desired financial and sustainable outcomes we hope to achieve to help investors and stakeholders \nunderstand the opportunities that can be unlocked in the future through present investments. Current financial and sustainability goals \nfor the Leap Ambitions relate to workforce safety, agriculture customer outcomes, product circularity, environmental footprint, Solutions \nas a Service, and equipment operations operating return on sales (OROS). \nWe aim to deliver ongoing value across our product lines by digitally connecting certain equipment we produce, enabling our customers to \nleverage technology for better economic and more sustainable outcomes in their businesses. We are measuring our customers’ utilization \nof our technology, in part, by the number of engaged acres, which is a measure of our PPA and SAT customers’ use of the John Deere \nOperations Center (our online farm management system). Engaged acres generally reflects the number of unique acres with at least one \noperation pass recorded in the Operations Center in the past 12 months. We are also introducing viable alternative power technologies for \nvarious product families. Furthermore, we plan to enhance how we deliver value by investing in a Solutions as a Service business model. \nWe also aim to enable our customers to be more sustainable in their production steps. For example, we provide our agricultural customers \nwith technology solutions that help to improve their crops’ nitrogen use efficiency and increase their crops’ protection efficiency. Across \nall segments we believe we will deliver ongoing value by continuing to focus on reducing the CO2e emissions from our equipment, \nincluding offering hybrid-electric and electric options where feasible in our product families. We also continue to work toward production \nof a fully autonomous, battery-powered agricultural tractor and have launched several models of electric turf and compact construction \nproducts. We also expect to support sustainable outcomes and deliver value through increasing the use of grade management control for \nearthmoving customers, intelligent boom control for forestry customers, and precision solutions for roadbuilding customers. \nEquipment Operations\nOur equipment operations consist of three of our business segments: PPA, SAT, and CF. In fiscal year 2024, PPA generated $20,834 \nnet sales, or 47 percent of equipment operations net sales; SAT generated $10,969 net sales, or 24 percent of equipment operations \nnet sales; and CF generated $12,956 net sales, or 29 percent of equipment operations net sales. \nProduction and Precision Agriculture \nThe PPA segment is committed to meeting the fundamental needs of our customers through a combination of equipment and \ntechnology designed to enable our customers to overcome some of their biggest challenges: doing more with less, labor shortages, \nvolatile input costs, and executing jobs in tighter timeframes. This segment defines, develops, and delivers global equipment and \ntechnology solutions for production-scale growers of crops like large grains (such as corn and soy), small grains (such as wheat, oats, \nand barley), cotton, and sugarcane. Equipment manufactured and distributed by the segment includes large and certain mid-size \ntractors, combines, cotton pickers, cotton strippers, sugarcane harvesters, and related harvesting front-end equipment. In addition, \nthe segment includes tillage, seeding, and application equipment, including sprayers and nutrient management and soil preparation \nmachinery. \n4 \nWe continue to invest in the development and production of advanced technology through integrated agricultural solutions and \nprecision technologies across our portfolio of equipment. For example, we have advanced our planting and crop care offerings for \ncorn and soy production systems to better meet customer demands throughout the cultivation cycle. \nWe have developed a differentiated, production system-level approach that helps us understand how customers operate, focusing on \ntheir costs, identifying the opportunities for them to reduce inputs, and improving productivity, crop yields, and sustainability. \nAdvancements such as precise global navigation satellite systems technology, advanced connectivity and telematics, on-board \nsensors and computing power, automation software, digital tools, applications, and analytics provide seamless integration of \ninformation designed to improve customer decision-making and job execution. Our advanced telematics systems remotely connect \nequipment owners, business managers, and dealers to equipment in the field. This connection provides real-time alerts and \ninformation about equipment location, utilization, performance, and maintenance to improve productivity and efficiency, as well as to \nmonitor agronomic job execution. \nIn fiscal year 2024, we introduced the new S7 Series combines and updated 9RX tractors, designed to enhance customer value and \naddress key agricultural challenges, such as time constraints caused by variable weather, labor shortages, and rising costs. The S7 \nSeries combines feature advanced automation packages and the 9RX tractors come with new engine options, updated technology \npackages, and modernized cabins. \nIn addition to John Deere brand names, the table below provides a list of PPA products and their associated brand names: \nPRODUCT BRAND NAME \nSprayers Hagie, Mazzotti \nPlanters and Cultivators Monosem \nSprayers and Planters PLA \nCarbon Fiber Sprayer Booms King Agro \nSugarcane Harvester Aftermarket Parts Sunbelt Outdoor Products, Unimil by John Deere \nAftermarket Parts for PPA Products Vapormatic, A & I, Unimil, Alternatives by John Deere, \nFrontier \nSmall Agriculture and Turf \nSAT is committed to meeting the needs of our customers through defining, developing, and delivering global equipment and technology \nsolutions designed to unlock value and sustainability for dairy and livestock producers, high-value crop and small acre crop producers, and \nturf and utility customers. The segment works to provide product leadership while extending integrated agricultural solutions and \nprecision technologies across its portfolio of equipment to unlock incremental value for customers. \nEquipment manufactured and distributed by the segment includes certain mid-size, small and utility tractors, and related loaders and \nattachments; turf and utility equipment, including riding lawn equipment, commercial mowing equipment, golf course equipment, utility \nvehicles, implements for mowing, tilling, snow and debris handling, aerating, and other residential, commercial, golf, and sports turf care \napplications; and hay and forage equipment, including self-propelled forage harvesters and attachments, balers, and mowers. SAT\nequipment is sold primarily through independent retail dealer networks, although the segment also builds turf products for sale by mass \nretailers, including The Home Depot and Lowe’s. Our turf equipment is sold primarily in North American, Western European, and \nAustralian markets. \nIn the small agriculture market, we have introduced autonomous solutions, connectivity capabilities, and a path to electrifying our future \nby delivering a portfolio that helps current customers meet sustainability goals while finding innovative ways to serve new customers and \nunlock new markets for mechanization at scale. \n5 \nIn addition to John Deere brand names, the table below provides a list of SAT products and their associated brand names: \n \nPRODUCT BRAND NAME \nEquipment Attachments Frontier, Kemper, GreenSystem, Smart Apply \nAftermarket Parts for SAT Vapormatic, A&I, Alternatives by John Deere, Frontier \nAgriculture and Turf Operations \nSmart Industrial Operating Model. As part of our Smart Industrial Operating Model, the segments are aligned around production \nsystems, enabling focus on delivering equipment, technology, and solutions across all the jobs customers execute during a season. \nSales and marketing support for both the PPA and SAT segments is organized around four geographic regions: U.S., Canada, and \nAustralia; Latin America and South America; Europe, and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS); and Africa, Asia, and the\nMiddle East. \nBusiness Environment. Sales of agricultural equipment are affected by total farm cash receipts, which reflect levels of farm \ncommodity prices, acreage planted, crop yields, and government policies, including global trade policies, and the amount and timing of \ngovernment payments. Sales also are influenced by general economic conditions, farmland prices, farmers’ debt levels and access to \nfinancing, interest and exchange rates, agricultural trends, including the production of and demand for renewable fuels, labor \navailability and costs, energy costs and related policies, tax policies, policies related to climate change, and other input costs \nassociated with farming. Other key factors affecting new agricultural equipment sales are the value, age, and level of used equipment, \nincluding tractors, harvesting equipment, self-propelled sprayers, hay and forage equipment, and seeding equipment. Weather and\nclimatic conditions also can affect buying decisions of agricultural equipment purchasers. \nWith challenging economic conditions including higher interest rates and decreasing crop prices, innovations in machinery and \ntechnology may have an even greater influence on agricultural equipment purchasing. For example, larger, more productive \nequipment is well accepted where farmers are striving for more efficiency in their operations to increase profits. Large, cost-efficient, \nhighly mechanized agricultural operations account for an important share of worldwide farm output. These customers are increasingly \nadopting and integrating precision agricultural technologies like guidance, telematics, automation, and data management in their \noperations. The large-size agricultural equipment used on such farms has been particularly important to us. A large proportion of the \nequipment operations’ total agricultural equipment sales in the U.S. and Canada, as well as in many countries outside the U.S. and \nCanada, are comprised of (1) tractors over 100 horsepower, (2) self-propelled combines, cotton pickers, forage harvesters, and \nsprayers, and (3) seeding equipment. In addition, small tractors are an important part of our global business. \nRetail sales of lawn and garden tractors, compact utility tractors, residential and commercial mowers, utility vehicles, and golf and turf \nequipment are influenced by the housing market, weather conditions, consumer spending patterns, and general economic conditions\nlike unemployment, interest rates, and inflation. \nSeasonality. Seasonal patterns in retail demand for agricultural equipment can result in substantial variations in the volume and mix of \nproducts sold to retail customers during the year. Seasonal demand is estimated in advance, and equipment is manufactured in \nanticipation of such demand to achieve efficient utilization of personnel and facilities throughout the year. The PPA and SAT \nsegments can incur substantial seasonal variations in cash flows to finance production and inventory of agricultural and turf \nequipment. The segments also incur costs to finance sales to dealers in advance of seasonal demand. \nFor certain equipment, we offer early order programs, which can include discounts to retail customers who place orders well in \nadvance of the use season. Production schedules are based, in part, on these early order programs; however, during periods of high \ndemand, some factories may still produce after the use season. New combines, cotton harvesting equipment, and sprayers are sold\nunder early order programs with waivers of retail finance charges available to customers who take delivery of machines during non\x02use seasons. \nIn Australia, Canada, and the U.S., there are typically several used equipment trade-in transactions that take place in connection with \nmost new agricultural equipment sales. To provide support to our dealers in these countries for carrying and ultimately selling this \nused inventory to retail customers, we provide these dealers with pools of funds awarded as a percentage of the dealer cost for\neligible new equipment sales at the time of the new equipment settlement. \nRetail demand for turf and utility equipment is normally higher in the second and third fiscal quarters. We have pursued a strategy of \nbuilding and shipping such equipment as close to retail demand as possible. Consequently, to increase asset turnover and reduce the \naverage level of field inventories throughout the year, production and shipment schedules of these product lines are normally \nproportionately higher in the second and third fiscal quarters of each year, corresponding closely to the seasonal pattern of retail sales. \n6 \nConstruction and Forestry\nOur CF segment is committed to meeting the need for smart and more sustainable solutions to help our customers meet industry \nchallenges, including jobsite safety, a shortage of skilled labor, volatile input costs, reducing rework, maximizing uptime, and \nminimizing their environmental footprint. \nTo address these challenges and unlock value for customers, we deliver a robust portfolio of construction, roadbuilding, and forestry \nproducts with precision technology solutions. Our smart solutions such as SmartWeigh™, grade control offerings, machine and system \nautomation, and Operations Center, are designed to allow customers to complete more functions with fewer inputs, reduce rework and \nguesswork, and transform data into insights to allow for better decisions. Obstacle detection solutions such as SmartDetect™supplement \noperator visibility on the jobsite through a combination of cameras, radar, and machine learning. Additionally, we plan to deliver hybrid\x02electric and battery electric equipment solutions to help customers reduce tailpipe emissions without sacrificing power and performance. \nOur primary construction products include excavators, wheel loaders, motor graders, dozers, backhoes, articulated dump trucks, skid \nsteers, compact excavators, and compact track loaders, along with a variety of attachments. Our Wirtgen roadbuilding products include \nmilling machines, pavers, compactors, rollers, crushers, screens, and asphalt plants. Similar to the construction product lineup, the \nWirtgen brand also provides a technology stack aimed at allowing customers to make smarter and more sustainable decisions. Technology \nofferings include Wirtgen Performance Tracker, Mill Assist, Level Pro, Vögele Roadscan, Smart Compact, WITOS Paving, Spective Connect, \nAutoTrac™, and John Deere Connected Support™. \nIn forestry, our primary products include skidders, wheeled and tracked feller bunchers, forwarders, knuckleboom loaders, wheeled and \ntracked harvesters, swing machines, and precision forestry technology solutions such as Intelligent Boom Control, TimberMatic™ maps, \nand TimberManager™. These solutions allow customers to closely track jobsite progress and provide visibility into fleet location, utilization, \nperformance, and maintenance information. \nWe have a number of initiatives in the rent-to-rent, or short-term rental, market for construction, earthmoving, roadbuilding, and \nmaterial handling equipment. These include specially designed rental programs for our dealers and expanded cooperation with major \nnational equipment rental companies. \nWe own retail forestry sales operations in Australia, Brazil, Finland, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. \nIn addition, the Wirtgen Group sells its products primarily through company-owned sales and service subsidiaries in many markets \nworldwide (most significantly in Europe, India, and Australia). In most other geographies, we sell through an independent dealer \nchannel. \nThe prevailing levels of residential, commercial, and public construction, investment in infrastructure, and the condition of the \nforestry products industry influence retail sales of our construction, roadbuilding, and forestry equipment. General economic \nconditions, interest rates, the availability of credit, and certain commodity prices, such as those applicable to oil and gas, pulp, paper, \nand saw logs, also influence sales. \nIn addition to John Deere brand names, the table below provides a list of CF products and their associated brand names: \nPRODUCT BRAND NAME \nRoadbuilding Equipment Wirtgen, Vögele, Hamm, Kleemann, Benninghoven, Ciber \nForestry Attachments Waratah \nCompetition\nThe equipment operations sell products and services in a variety of competitive global and regional markets. The principal competitive \nfactors in all markets include product performance, innovation, quality, distribution, sustainability, customer service, and value. John \nDeere’s brand recognition is a competitive factor in North America and many other parts of the world. \nThe agricultural equipment industry continues to change and is becoming even more competitive through the emergence and global \nexpansion of many competitors. The competitive environment for the agriculture and turf operations includes some global \ncompetitors, such as AGCO Corporation, CLAAS KGaA mbH, CNH Industrial N.V., Kubota Tractor Corporation, Mahindra & Mahindra \nLimited, and The Toro Company. These competitors have varying numbers of product lines competing with our products and each has\nvarying degrees of regional focus. Additional competition within the agricultural equipment industry has come from a variety of short\x02line and specialty manufacturers, as well as local or regional competitors, with differing manufacturing and marketing methods. As \ntechnology increasingly enables enhanced productivity in agriculture, the industry is also attracting non-traditional competitors, \nincluding technology-focused companies and start-up ventures. \n7 \nOur forestry and roadbuilding businesses operate globally. The construction business operates in competitive markets in North and \nSouth America, as well as other global markets.

Our flexible assembly lines, which can accommodate a wide \nproduct mix and deliver products in line with changes in dealer and customer demand, support our process improvements.\nSee Item 2 “Properties” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information about our manufacturing facilities.\nResearch and Development; Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights, and Trade Secrets\nWe make substantial investments in research and development to improve the quality and performance of our products, to develop new \nproducts and technologies to meet our customers’ needs, to integrate sustainable solutions into our products, and to comply with \ngovernment, safety, and engine emissions regulations. \nOur research and development activities are a vital component in our Smart Industrial Operating Model as customers seek to improve \nprofitability, productivity, and sustainability through technology. Integration of technology into equipment is a persistent market trend, \nand we continue to capitalize on this market trend. \nWe own a significant number of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and intellectual property licenses related to our products \nand services and expect the number to grow as we continue to pursue technological innovations. We further our competitive position by \nfiling patent and trademark applications in the U.S. and internationally to protect technology, improvements considered important to the \nbusiness, and our brand. We believe that, taken together, our rights under these patents and licenses are important to our operations and \ncompetitive position but do not regard any of our businesses as being dependent upon any single patent or family of patents. See “Risk \nFactors - Our business could be adversely affected by the infringement or loss of intellectual property rights” for more information. \nSales and Distribution \nThrough the U.S. and Canada, we market products to approximately 2,050 independent dealer locations. Of these, approximately 1,600 \nsell agricultural equipment, while approximately 450 sell construction, earthmoving, material handling, roadbuilding, compact \nconstruction, and/or forestry equipment. In addition, roadbuilding equipment is sold at approximately 100 roadbuilding-only locations \nthat may carry products that compete with our construction, earthmoving, material handling, and/or forestry equipment. Turf equipment \nis sold at most John Deere agricultural equipment locations, a few construction, earthmoving, material handling, roadbuilding, and/or \nforestry equipment locations, and about 280 turf-only locations. In addition, certain lawn and garden and compact construction products \nare sold through The Home Depot and Lowe’s. \nOutside the U.S. and Canada, our agriculture and turf equipment is sold to distributors and dealers for resale in over 100 countries. Sales \nand administrative offices are located in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Mexico, Poland, Singapore, \nSweden, South Africa, Spain, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom. Turf equipment sales outside the U.S. and Canada occur primarily in \nWestern Europe and Australia. Construction, earthmoving, material handling, and forestry equipment is sold to distributors and dealers \nprimarily by sales offices located in Australia, Brazil, Finland, New Zealand, Singapore, and the United Kingdom. Some of these dealers are \nindependently owned while we own others. Roadbuilding equipment is sold directly to retail customers and independent distributors and \ndealers for resale. The Wirtgen Group operates company-owned sales and service subsidiaries in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, \nChina, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Malaysia, the \nNetherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, South Africa, Sweden, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom. The \nequipment operations operate centralized parts distribution warehouses in the U.S., Brazil, and Germany in coordination with regional \nparts depots and distribution centers in Argentina, Australia, China, India, Mexico, South Africa, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. \nWe market engines, power trains, and electronic components worldwide through select sales branches or directly to regional and global \noriginal equipment manufacturers and independently owned engine distributors. \n8 \nRaw Materials\nWe source raw materials, manufactured components, and replacement parts for our equipment, engines, and other products from leading \nsuppliers both domestically and internationally. These materials and components include a variety of steel products, metal castings, \nforgings, plastics, hydraulics, electronics, and ready-to-assemble components made to certain specifications. We also source various \ngoods and services used for production, logistics, offices, and research and development. We develop and maintain sourcing strategies \nfor our purchased materials and emphasize long-term supplier relationships at the core of these strategies. We use a variety of\nagreements with suppliers intended to drive innovation, ensure availability and delivery of raw materials and components, manage costs \non a globally competitive basis, protect our intellectual property, and minimize other supply-related risks. We are focused on proactively \nincreasing the resiliency of our supply chain and actively monitoring supply chain risks to minimize the likelihood of business disruptions \ncaused by the supply base, including supplier financial viability, capacity, business continuity, labor availability, quality, delivery, \ncybersecurity, weather-related events, and natural disasters. We have implemented mitigation efforts to minimize the impact of potential \nand actual supply chain disruptions on our customers. Examples include working with the supply base to prioritize allocations to improve \nmaterial availability, multi-sourcing selected parts and materials, entering long-term contracts for some critical components, and using \nalternative freight carriers to expedite delivery. \nBacklog Orders \nThe dollar amount of backlog orders as of October 27, 2024 was approximately $5.2 billion for the PPA segment and $2.1 billion for the \nSAT segment, compared with $7.9 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively, at October 29, 2023. The agriculture and turf backlog are generally \nhighest in the second and third quarters due to seasonal buying trends in these industries. The dollar amount of backlog orders for the CF \nsegment was approximately $2.2 billion at October 27, 2024, compared with $6.4 billion at October 29, 2023. Backlog orders for \nequipment operations include all orders deemed to be firm as of the referenced date. Backlog orders decreased as demand has declined. \nFinancial Services\nU.S. and Canada. The financial services segment primarily provides and administers financing for retail purchases from our dealers of new \nequipment manufactured by our agricultural and turf and construction and forestry operations, as well as used equipment taken in trade \nfor this equipment. The Company and John Deere Construction & Forestry Company (a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company) are \nreferred to as the “sales companies.” John Deere Capital Corporation (Capital Corporation), a U.S. financial services subsidiary, generally \npurchases retail installment sales and loan contracts (retail notes) from the sales companies. In Canada, John Deere Financial Inc., a \nCanadian financial services subsidiary, purchases and finances retail notes acquired by John Deere Canada ULC, our Canadian sales \ncompany. The terms of retail notes and the basis on which the financial services operations acquire retail notes from the sales companies \nare governed by agreements with the sales companies. The financial services segment also finances and services revolving charge\naccounts, in most cases acquired from and offered through merchants in the agricultural and turf markets. Additionally, the financial \nservices operations provide wholesale financing to dealers of our agriculture and turf equipment and construction and forestry equipment \n(wholesale notes), primarily to finance inventories of equipment for those dealers. The various financing options offered by the financial \nservices operations are designed to enhance sales of our products and generate financing income for the financial services operations. In \nthe U.S. and Canada, certain subsidiaries included in the financial services segment offer extended equipment warranties. \nRetail notes acquired by the sales companies are immediately sold to the financial services operations. The equipment operations are the \nfinancial services operations’ major source of business, although many retail purchasers of our products finance their purchases outside \nour organization through a variety of sources, including commercial banks and finance and leasing companies. \nThe financial services operations offer retail leases to equipment users in the U.S. A small number of leases are executed with units of local \ngovernments. Leases are usually written for periods ranging from less than one year to seven years, and typically contain an option \npermitting the customer to purchase the equipment at the end of the lease term. Retail leases also are offered in a generally similar \nmanner to customers in Canada. \nThe financial services operations’ terms for financing equipment retail sales (other than smaller items financed with unsecured revolving \ncharge accounts) generally provide for retention of a security interest in the equipment financed. Finance charges are sometimes waived \nfor specified periods or reduced on certain John Deere products sold or leased in advance of the season of use or in other sales \npromotions. The financial services operations generally receive compensation from the sales companies at approximate market interest \nrates for periods during which finance charges are waived or reduced on the retail notes or leases. The cost is accounted for as a deduction \nin arriving at net sales by the equipment operations. \nWe have an agreement with Capital Corporation to make payments to Capital Corporation such that its consolidated ratio of earnings to \nfixed charges is not less than 1.05 to 1 for any four consecutive fiscal quarterly periods. We also have committed to continuing to own, \ndirectly or through one or more wholly-owned subsidiaries, at least 51 percent of the voting shares of capital stock of Capital Corporation \nand to maintain Capital Corporation’s consolidated tangible net worth at not less than $50 million. Our obligations to make payments to \n9 \nCapital Corporation under this agreement are independent of whether Capital Corporation is in default on its indebtedness, obligations, or \nother liabilities. Further, our obligations under the agreement are not measured by the amount of Capital Corporation’s indebtedness, \nobligations, or other liabilities. Our obligations to make payments under this agreement are expressly stated not to be a guaranty of any \nspecific indebtedness, obligation, or liability of Capital Corporation and are enforceable only by or in the name of Capital Corporation. As \nof October 27, 2024, we were in compliance with all of our obligations, and no payments were required under this agreement in fiscal year \n2024 or fiscal year 2023. As of October 27, 2024, we indirectly owned 100 percent of the voting shares of Capital Corporation’s capital \nstock and Capital Corporation’s consolidated tangible net worth was $6,226.2 million. \nOutside the U.S. and Canada. The financial services operations also offer financing, primarily for our products, in Argentina, Australia, \nBrazil, India, Mexico, New Zealand, and in several other countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America. In certain markets, financing is \noffered through cooperation agreements or joint ventures with other financial institutions. For example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal \nyear 2024, we entered into a joint venture agreement with a Brazilian bank, Banco Bradesco S.A. (Bradesco), for Bradesco to invest and \nbecome 50 percent owner of our subsidiary in Brazil, Banco John Deere S.A.. The way the financial services operations offer financing is \naffected by a variety of country-specific laws, regulations, and customs, including those governing property rights and debtor obligations, \nwhich are subject to change, and which may introduce greater risk to the financial services operations. \nThe financial services operations also offer to select customers and dealers credit enhanced international export financing primarily for the \npurchase of our products. \nAdditional information on the financial services operations is provided in the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial \nCondition and Results of Operations” (MD&A) section in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nEnvironmental Matters\nWe are subject to a variety of local, state, and federal environmental laws and regulations in the U.S., as well as the environmental laws \nand regulations of other countries in which we conduct business. We strive to comply with applicable laws and regulations; however, in \nthe event of noncompliance, we could be subject to fines and other penalties. Compliance with these laws and regulations adds to the cost \nof our production operations and compliance with emissions regulations adds to the cost of our products. In fiscal year 2024, compliance \nwith environmental controls applicable to us did not have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. \nAt this time, we do not expect to incur material capital expenditures related to environmental controls during fiscal year 2025. In addition \nto ensuring compliance with laws and regulations, we aim to reduce our environmental footprint through our Leap Ambitions framework \nand seek opportunities to reduce environmental impacts on the communities where we operate. \nThe U.S., the European Union (EU), India, and other governments throughout the world have enacted, and continue to enact, laws and \nregulations to reduce off-road engine emissions. Compliance with these regulations requires significant investments in the development \nof new engine technologies and after-treatment systems. \nGovernments also are implementing laws regulating products across their life cycles, including raw material sourcing and the storage, \ndistribution, sale, use, and disposal of products at their end of life. These laws and regulations include requirements to develop less \nhazardous chemical substances and products, right-to-know, restriction of hazardous substances, and product take-back laws. \nWe are evaluating, cleaning-up, or conducting corrective action at a limited number of sites. We do not expect that these matters or other \nexpenses or liabilities we may incur in connection with any noncompliance with environmental laws, regulations, or the clean-up of any \nadditional properties, will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or \ncompetitive position. \nWe continue to monitor and review developing sustainability frameworks, standards, and global regulations. \nWith respect to properties and businesses that have been or will be acquired, we conduct due diligence into potential exposure to \nenvironmental liabilities but cannot be certain that we have identified, or will identify, all adverse environmental conditions. \nGovernment Regulations\nWe are subject to a wide variety of local, state, and federal laws and regulations in the countries where we operate. These laws and \nregulations include a range of trade, product, anti-bribery, anti-corruption, foreign exchange, employment, tax, environmental, safety, \ndata privacy, telecommunications, antitrust, and other laws and regulations. \nCompliance with these laws and regulations often requires the dedication of time and effort of our employees, as well as financial \nresources. In fiscal year 2024, compliance with the regulations applicable to us did not have a material effect on our capital expenditures, \nearnings, or competitive position. At this time, we do not expect to incur material capital expenditures related to compliance with \nregulations during fiscal year 2025. Additional information about the impact of government regulations on our business is included in Item \n1A, “Risk Factors – Strategy Risks” and “Compliance Risks.” \n10 \nHuman Capital\nOur employees are guided by a simple principle: We run so life can leap forward. Employees are further guided by our Code of Business \nConduct (Code), which helps them to uphold and strengthen the standards of honor and integrity that have defined John Deere since \nour founding. And while our world and business may change, we continue to be guided by our core values — Integrity, Quality, \nHumanity, Commitment, and Innovation. Humanity was added as our fifth core value in fiscal year 2024. \nEmployees \nAt October 27, 2024, we had approximately 75,800 employees, of which approximately 35,200 are full-time production employees. \nWe had 29,600 total employees in the U.S. of which approximately 13,300 were production employees. We also retain consultants, \nindependent contractors, and temporary and part-time workers. \nUnions are certified as bargaining agents for approximately 77 percent of our U.S. production and maintenance employees. \nApproximately 8,900 of our active U.S. production and maintenance workers are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with\nthe United Auto Workers (UAW), with an expiration date of November 1, 2027. A small number of U.S. production employees are \nrepresented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM). Collective bargaining agreements covering \nour employees in the U.S. expire between 2025 and 2027. Unions also represent the majority of employees at our manufacturing \nfacilities outside the U.S. \nThere is no guarantee that we will be able to renew collective bargaining agreements or whether such agreements will be on terms \nsatisfactory to us. For further discussion, see “Risk Factors—Disputes with labor unions may adversely affect our ability to operate in our \nfacilities as well as impact our financial results.” \nCode of Business Conduct \nWe are committed to conducting business in accordance with the highest ethical standards. We require all employees to complete training \non our Code and also require that employees regularly certify compliance with the Code. The Code provides specific guidance to all our \nemployees outlining how they can and must uphold and strengthen the integrity that has defined John Deere since our founding. In \naddition, we maintain a global compliance hotline to report concerns of potential violations of the Code, global policies, or the law. \nHealth and Safety \nWe strive to achieve safety excellence through increased focus on injury prevention, leading indicators, risk reduction, and health and \nsafety management systems. We have made progress on implementing best practices and leading indicators for enabling employee safety \nover recent years with our Health and Safety Management System. \nWe utilize a safety balanced scorecard, which includes leading and lagging indicators, and is designed to enable continuous measurement \nof safety performance and drive continuous improvement. Leading indicators include incident corrective action closure rates, ergonomic \nscorecard, and risk reduction from safety and ergonomic risk assessment projects. Lagging indicators include total recordable incident \nrate, ergonomic recordable case rate, lost time frequency rate, and near-miss rate. Leading and lagging indicators are tracked by most of \nour manufacturing facilities and internally reported. In fiscal year 2024, we reported a total recordable incident rate of 1.69 and a lost time \nfrequency rate of 0.63. To improve our total recordable incident rate, we will prioritize injury prevention and risk reduction strategies and \nimprove ergonomic programs. \nWorkplace Practices and Policies \nWe are an equal opportunity employer committed to providing a workplace free of harassment and discrimination. We believe that a \ndiverse workforce that reflects the communities we serve is essential to our long-term success. For recruiting and development \nopportunities, we work with a variety of professional organizations to support a diverse pipeline of candidates representing the fields of \naccounting, agriculture, engineering, general business, science, and technology, and provide development opportunities for employees. \nCompensation & Benefits \nOur total rewards are intended to be competitive, meet the varied needs of our global workforce, and reinforce our values. We are \ncommitted to providing comprehensive and competitive pay and benefits to our employees. We continue to invest in employees through \ngrowth and development and well-being initiatives.\nOur work environment is designed to promote innovation, well-being, and reward performance. Our total rewards for employees include a \nvariety of components that aim to support our employees in building a strong financial future, including competitive market-based pay \nand comprehensive benefits. In addition to earning base pay, eligible employees are compensated for their contributions to our goals with \nboth short-term cash incentives and long-term equity-based incentives.\n11 \nEligible full-time employees in the U.S. have access to medical, dental, and vision plans; savings and retirement plans; parental leave and \npaid time off; and mental health and wellness services. We also offer a variety of working arrangements to eligible employees, including \nflexible schedules, remote work, and job sharing to help employees manage home and work-life situations. Programs and benefits differ \ninternationally for a variety of reasons, such as local legal requirements, market practices, and negotiations with works councils, trade \nunions, and other employee representative bodies. \nTraining and Development \nAround the world, we offer internships, training, upskilling, apprenticeships, and leadership development at all stages of an employee’s \ncareer. Training programs are tailored to different geographic regions and job functions and include topics such as technical operation of \nequipment, equipment assembly, relationships with customers and dealers, our culture and values, compliance with the Code, compliance \nwith anti-bribery/corruption laws and policies, compliance with management of private data and cybersecurity, conflicts of interest, \ndiscrimination and workplace harassment policies, sexual harassment policies, and leadership development. \nAvailable Information \nOur internet address is http://www.deere.com.

RISK FACTORS. \nThe following risks are considered material to our business based upon current knowledge, information, and assumptions. This \ndiscussion of risk factors should be considered closely in conjunction with the MD&A, including the risks and uncertainties described in \nthe Forward-Looking Statements, and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These risk factors and other forward-looking \nstatements relate to future events, expectations, trends, and operating periods. They involve certain factors that are subject to \nchange and important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties \ncould affect particular lines of business, while others could affect all our businesses. Although the risks are organized by headings and \neach risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated. The risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Forward\x02Looking Statements in this report are not the only risks we face. \nOPERATIONAL RISKS \nOur financial results largely depend upon the agricultural market business cycle, as well as general economic conditions and outlook. \nNegative conditions in the agricultural industry and general economy cause weakened demand for our equipment and services, limit \naccess to funding, and result in higher funding costs. \nOur success largely depends on the vitality of the agricultural industry. Historically, the agricultural industry has been cyclical and \nsubject to a variety of economic and other factors. Sales of agricultural equipment, in turn, are also cyclical and generally reflect the \neconomic health of the agricultural industry. The economic health of the agricultural industry is affected by numerous factors,\nincluding farm income, farmland values, and debt levels and financing costs, all of which are influenced by the levels of commodity and \nprotein prices, world grain stocks, acreage available and planted, crop yields, agricultural product demand, soil conditions, farm input \ncosts, government policies, and government subsidies. Downturns in the agricultural industry due to these and other factors, which \ncould vary by market, have resulted in decreases in demand for agricultural equipment, adversely affecting our performance. \nThe demand for our products and services depends on the fundamentals in the markets in which we operate and can be significantly \nreduced in an economic environment characterized by high unemployment, high interest rates, cautious consumer spending, inflation, \nlower corporate earnings, and lower business investment. In fiscal year 2024, unfavorable market conditions resulted in lower sales \nvolumes, higher sales discounts, higher receivable write offs, and a higher provision for credit losses. We expect certain of these \nconditions to persist in fiscal year 2025. Changes in interest rates and the agricultural market business cycle are driven by factors \noutside of our control, and as a result we cannot reasonably foresee when these conditions will fully subside. \nSustained general negative economic conditions and outlook also affect housing starts, energy prices and demand, and other \nconstruction, which dampens demand for certain construction equipment. Our turf operations and our construction and forestry \nsegments are dependent on construction activity and have also been affected by recent adverse economic conditions. Decreases in\nconstruction activity and housing starts have had a material adverse effect on our financial results. \nUncertain or negative outlook with respect to pervasive U.S. fiscal issues as well as general economic conditions and outlook, such as \nmarket volatility or interest rate changes, have caused and could continue to cause significant changes in market liquidity conditions. \nSuch changes could impact access to funding and associated funding costs, which could reduce our earnings and cash flows. \nWe may be unable to manage increasing political, economic, and social uncertainty in certain regions of the world, which could \nsignificantly change the dynamics of our competition, customer base, and product offerings globally. \nEfforts to grow our businesses depend in part upon access to and developing market share and profitability in additional geographic \nmarkets, including, but not limited to, Argentina, Brazil, CIS, China, India, and South Africa. There are various risks associated with our \nglobal footprint, including, but not limited to, the following: \n• In some cases, these countries have greater political and economic volatility, greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor \ndisruptions, and differing customer product preferences and requirements than our other markets. \n• Having business operations in various regions and countries exposes us to multiple and potentially conflicting business \npractices and legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change. These practices and legal requirements are often \ncomplex and difficult to navigate, including those related to tariffs and trade regulations, investments, property ownership \nrights, taxation, repatriation of earnings, and advanced technologies. \n• Expanding business operations globally also increases exposure to currency fluctuations, which can materially affect our \nfinancial results. In Argentina, the government has certain capital and currency controls that restrict our ability to access U.S. \ndollars and remit earnings from our Argentine operations, leaving us exposed to long-term currency fluctuations. \n• While our brands are widely recognized in our traditional markets, they are less known in some emerging markets, which \ncould impede our efforts to successfully compete in these markets. \n14 \n• Changing U.S. export controls and sanctions on various foreign countries and on various parties could affect our ability to \ncollect receivables, provide aftermarket warranty support for our equipment, and sell products, and could otherwise impact \nour reputation and business. \n• Market uncertainty and volatility in various geographies have been magnified as a result of potential shifts in U.S. and foreign \ntrade, economic, and other policies following the 2024 U.S. presidential and congressional elections. \n• Geopolitical tensions, including the Russia/Ukraine war and the conflict in the Middle East, have also exacerbated market \nvolatility and affected agricultural global production and demand levels. \nWe may be affected by changing worldwide demand for food and different forms of renewable energy, which could impact the price of \nfarm commodities and consequently the demand for our equipment. This could result in higher research and development costs related \nto changing machine fuel requirements. \nChanging worldwide demand for farm outputs to meet the world’s growing food and renewable energy demands, driven in part by \ngovernment policies, including those related to climate change, and a growing world population, are likely to result in fluctuating \nagricultural commodity prices, which directly affect sales of agricultural equipment. Lower agricultural commodity prices directly affect \nfarm incomes, which negatively affect sales of agricultural equipment and result in higher credit losses. While higher commodity prices \nbenefit our crop-producing agricultural equipment customers, they could result in greater feed costs for livestock and poultry \nproducers, which in turn may result in lower levels of equipment purchased by these customers. In addition, changing energy demands \nmay cause farmers to change the types or quantities of the crops they raise, with corresponding changes in equipment demands. \nFinally, changes in governmental policies regulating fuel utilization, including biofuel, affect commodity demand and commodity\nprices, demand for our diesel-fueled equipment, and result in higher research and development costs related to equipment fuel \nstandards. \nChanges in the availability and price of certain raw materials, components, and whole goods have resulted and could result in \ndisruptions to the supply chain causing production disruptions, increased costs, and lower profits on sales of our products. \nWe require access to various raw materials, components, and whole goods at competitive prices to manufacture and distribute our\nproducts. \nWe have experienced changes in the availability and prices of raw materials, components, whole goods, and freight over the past\nseveral years, especially in fiscal years 2021 and 2022. Global logistics network challenges resulted in delays, shortages of key \nmanufacturing components, increased order backlogs, increased transportation costs, and production inefficiencies from a higher\nnumber of partially completed machines in inventory, which increased our overall production and overhead costs. Increases in such \ncosts have had an adverse effect on our business operations. While we have seen stabilization in the supply chain and inflation, we \nanticipate potential future fluctuations due to continued geopolitical and economic uncertainty, and regulatory and policy instability, \nincluding import tariffs and trade agreements. The latter have the potential to significantly increase production and logistics costs and \nhave a material negative effect on the profitability of the business, particularly if we are unable to recover the increased costs due to \nmarket considerations or other factors. \nWe rely on our suppliers to acquire the raw materials, components, and whole goods required to manufacture their products. \nSignificant disruptions to the supply chain resulting from shortages of raw materials, components, and whole goods have and could \ncontinue to adversely affect our ability to meet commitments to our customers. Work interruption or union strikes by employees of \nsuppliers could also contribute to disruptions within our supply chain. In addition, certain materials and components used in our \nproducts are acquired from a single supplier or are proprietary in nature and cannot be alternatively sourced expeditiously. \nFurthermore, if our customers are unwilling to accept price increases for our products, or if we are unable to offset the increases in \ncosts, raw material costs or shortages could have a material adverse effect on our operational or financial results. \nFailure by our supply base to use ethical business practices and comply with applicable laws and regulations may adversely affect our \nbusiness, financial condition, and operational results. \nWhile we conduct due diligence on our suppliers and require their compliance with various policies and contractual covenants, we do \nnot control our suppliers’ business practices. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that our due diligence efforts will reveal that they \nfollow ethical business practices such as fair wage practices and compliance with environmental, safety, labor, human rights, material \nsourcing, and other laws. A lack of compliance could lead us to seek alternative suppliers, which could increase our costs and result in \ndelayed delivery of our products, product shortages, or other disruptions of our operations. If our suppliers or retail partners fail to \ncomply with applicable laws, regulations, safety codes, employment practices, human rights standards, quality standards, \nenvironmental standards, production practices, or other obligations, norms, identification and reporting requirements, or ethical \nstandards, our reputation and brand could be harmed, and we could be exposed to litigation, investigations, enforcement actions, \nmonetary liability and additional costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of \noperations. \n15 \nUnfavorable weather conditions or natural catastrophes that reduce agricultural production and demand for agriculture and turf \nequipment could directly and indirectly affect our business. \nThe purchasing decisions of our customers, particularly the purchasers of agriculture and turf equipment, can be significantly affected \nby poor or unusual weather conditions. Such conditions include: \n• Insufficient levels of rain, which prevent farmers from planting new crops and may cause growing crops to die or result in \nlower yields; \n• Excessive rain or flooding can prevent planting from occurring at optimal times and may cause crop loss through increased \ndisease or mold growth; \n• Temperatures outside normal ranges, which can cause crop failure or decreased yields and may also affect disease incidence; \n• Natural disasters such as regional floods, hurricanes or other storms, droughts, diseases, wildfires, and pests, either as a \nphysical effect of climate change or otherwise, which have had, and could in the future have, significant negative effects on \nagricultural and livestock production; \n• Adverse weather conditions in a particular geographic region, particularly during the important spring selling season; and \n• Drought conditions can adversely affect sales of certain mowing equipment and can similarly cause lower sales volume. \nEach of these conditions could negatively affect demand for agricultural and turf equipment and the financial condition and credit risk \nof our dealers and customers. \nUnexpected events have increased and may in the future increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations. \nThe occurrence of one or more unexpected events, including war, acts of terrorism, epidemics and pandemics (such as the COVID \npandemic), civil unrest, fires, tornadoes, tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, and other forms of severe weather in the United \nStates or in other countries in which we operate, or in which our suppliers are located, have adversely affected and could in the future \nadversely affect our operations and financial performance. Such events have caused and could cause complete or partial closure of one \nor more of our manufacturing facilities or distribution centers, temporary or long-term disruptions in the supply of component \nproducts from some local and international suppliers, and disruption and delay in the transport of products to dealers, end-users, and \ndistribution centers. Most recently, Hurricane Helene in the U.S. closed operations at our Augusta, Georgia and Greenville, Tennessee \nfacilities temporarily. Existing insurance coverage may not provide protection from all the costs that may arise from such events. \nThe potential physical impacts of climate change on our facilities, suppliers, and customers, and therefore on our operations, are highly \nuncertain and will be particular to the circumstances developing in various geographic regions. These potential physical effects may \nadversely affect the demand for our products and the cost, production, sales, and financial performance of our operations. \nOur business could be adversely affected by the infringement or loss of intellectual property rights. \nWe protect our intellectual property with a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secret laws, and legal agreements. \nWe heavily rely on certain trademarks to protect our identity and customer recognition of our products and services, including, but not \nlimited to, the “John Deere” mark, the leaping deer logo, the “Nothing Runs Like a Deere” slogan, and the green and yellow color \ncombination. These trademarks, as well as the many patents that protect innovations used in our products, are integral to our \nbusiness, and their loss could have a material adverse effect on us. \nAdditionally, third parties may initiate legal proceedings to challenge the validity of our intellectual property or allege that we infringe \non their intellectual property. We may incur substantial costs if third parties initiate such legal proceedings, or if we initiate legal \nproceedings to protect or enforce our intellectual property. If the outcome of any such legal proceedings is unfavorable to us, our \nbusiness could be adversely affected. \nRationalization or restructuring of manufacturing facilities, and plant expansions and updates at our manufacturing facilities may \ncause capacity constraints, inventory fluctuations, and other issues. \nThe rationalization or restructuring of our manufacturing facilities, including relocating production or closing facilities, may result in \ntemporary constraints on our ability to produce the quantity of products necessary to fill orders and thereby complete sales in a timely \nmanner. In addition, decisions regarding the rationalization, restructuring or relocation of facilities, such as the recently announced \nshifting of production of skid steer loaders and compact track loaders from our Dubuque, Iowa factory to Ramos, Mexico, and any\nsimilar actions we may undertake in the future, could also subject us to additional or new tariffs, other issues relating to the \nimportation of products, fines, and reputational risks. Finally, the expansion and reconfiguration of existing manufacturing facilities, \nas well as new or expanded manufacturing operations in emerging markets, such as Brazil, could increase the risk of production delays, \nas well as require significant investments. \n16 \nChanges in tax rates, tax legislation, or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a negative effect on our business. \nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our domestic and international tax liabilities are \ndependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions. Tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to \nsignificant change. Our effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax \nrates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretations. If our effective tax \nrates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of taxes owed is for an amount more than amounts previously accrued, our \noperating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be adversely affected. \nOur consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. dollars while certain assets and other reported items are denominated in foreign \ncurrencies, creating currency exchange and translation risk. \nWe are a global company with transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. We are subject to currency exchange risk to the \nextent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn our revenues. \nAdditionally, the reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollar. Certain of our assets, liabilities, \nexpenses, and revenues are denominated in other countries’ currencies, which are then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable \nexchange rates and reported in our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates affect the \nvalue of those items as reflected in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value remains unchanged in the original \ncurrencies. While the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in currency \nexchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego any benefits that may result from favorable fluctuations in such \nrates. In Argentina, we have employed mechanisms to convert Argentine pesos into U.S. dollars to the extent possible. These \nmechanisms are short-term in nature, leaving us exposed to long-term currency fluctuations. \nChanges in interest rates or market liquidity conditions, as well as changes in government banking, monetary and fiscal policies, could \nadversely affect our financials and our earnings and/or cash flows. \nWhile central banks began cutting their policy interest rates in the latter part of fiscal year 2024, interest rates remain above recent \nnorms. High interest rates can have a dampening effect on overall economic activity and/or the financial condition of our customers, \neither or both of which can negatively affect customer demand for our equipment and customers’ ability to repay their obligations to \nus. While we strive to match the interest rate characteristics of our financial assets and liabilities, changing interest rates have had an \nadverse effect on our financing spreads—the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rates we pay for \nfunding—which has affected our earnings. \nIn addition, actions by credit rating agencies, such as downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlooks, can affect the availability \nand cost of funding for us and can increase our costs of capital and hurt our competitive position. \nMoreover, policies of the U.S. and other governments regarding banking, monetary, and fiscal policies intended to promote or \nmaintain liquidity, stabilize financial markets, and/or address local deficit or structural economic issues have a material impact on our \ncustomers and markets. \nOur operations and results could also be affected by financial regulatory reform that could, among other things, have an adverse \neffect on the financial services segment and on our customers by limiting their ability to enter hedging transactions or to finance \npurchases of our products. Government policies on spending can also affect us, especially the CF segment, due to the impact of \ngovernment spending on infrastructure development. Our operations, including those outside of the U.S., may also be affected by\nnon-U.S. regulatory reforms being implemented to further regulate non-U.S. financial institutions and markets. \nBecause the financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of our sales worldwide, negative economic \nconditions in the financial industry could materially impact our operations and financial results. \nNegative economic conditions have an adverse effect on the financial industry in which the financial services segment operates. The \nfinancial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of our sales worldwide. The financial services segment is \nvulnerable to customers and others defaulting on contractual obligations, and has experienced, and may continue to experience write\x02offs and credit losses that, in some cases, exceed our expectations and adversely affect our financial condition and results of\noperations as a result of elevated delinquencies. The financial services segment’s inability to access funds at cost-effective rates to \nsupport our financing activities could have a material adverse effect on our business. The financial services segment’s liquidity and \nongoing profitability depend largely on timely access to capital to meet future cash flow requirements and to fund operations and \ncosts associated with engaging in diversified funding activities. The financial services segment may also experience residual value \nlosses that exceed our expectations caused by lower pricing for used equipment and higher-than-expected equipment returns at lease \nmaturity. \n17 \nSTRATEGY RISKS \nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of our Smart Industrial Operating Model and Leap Ambitions. \nFailure to realize the anticipated benefits of our Smart Industrial Operating Model and related business strategies in production \nsystems, precision technologies, and aftermarket support, as well as failure to have selected a business strategy that aligns with our \ncustomer needs and market trends, could have an adverse effect on our operational and financial results. Several factors could impact \nour ability to successfully execute our Smart Industrial Operating Model, including, among other things: \n• Failure to accurately assess market opportunities and the technology required to address such opportunities; \n• Failure to develop and introduce new technologies or lack of adoption of such technologies by our customers; \n• Failure to holistically provide lifecycle solutions; \n• Failure to optimize our capital allocation in connection with the Smart Industrial Operating Model; and \n• The adoption of new regulations or policies supporting and/or subsidizing outputs that are inconsistent with our strategy, \nsuch as policies that have the effect of encouraging or supporting the use of conventional sources of energy. \nSimilarly, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of our Leap Ambitions and related goals within the expected timelines, or at all. \nAs part of our Leap Ambitions, we adopted various goals we expect to achieve by 2026 or 2030, but these goals and their timelines \nmight be modified or updated. We may modify or not be able to achieve these goals for a variety of reasons, some of which may be \nbeyond our control. Examples include: \n• Our estimates and assumptions related to efficiency of our products and the adoption of precision technology may not be \naccurate; \n• Certain materials, such as quality battery cells, may become unavailable or too costly; \n• Customers may not embrace the value proposition of the Solutions as a Service license model; and \n• The infrastructure required to achieve our goals, such as sufficient charging stations or fuel availability, may become too \ncostly or may not be developed on the expected timelines. \nIf we are unable to remain competitive and relevant, including by delivering precision technology solutions to our customers, our \nbusiness, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected. \nWe compete on product performance, innovation and quality, distribution, sustainability, customer service, and price. Aggressive \npricing or other strategies of competitors, unanticipated product or manufacturing delays, our failure to deliver quality products that \nmeet customer needs, or our failure to price products competitively adversely affects our business, results of operations, and financial \ncondition. To remain competitive, we need to have a thorough understanding of our existing and potential customers on a global \nbasis, particularly in growth markets such as Argentina and Brazil. \nIn addition, if we are unable to remain relevant and effectively develop and deliver technology that customers can easily adopt and \nutilize, customer adoption rates could reduce, adversely impacting our business operations and future financial performance. \nTherefore, our ability to deliver precision technology and expand value-driven solutions is critical to our business success. If we fail to \nstay ahead of both traditional and non-traditional competitors in the technology space, it may hinder our ability to adapt or identify \nstrategic partnerships within our industries in a timely manner. This could result in increased costs and delays in delivering value to our \ncustomers, ultimately affecting our competitive position and financial condition. \nFurthermore, our approach to precision technology involves hardware and software, guidance, connectivity and digital solutions,\nautomation and machine intelligence, and autonomy. We may make significant investments in research and development, connectivity \nsolutions, digital security for precision technology solutions, and conduct dealer and employee training. These investments may not \nproduce solutions that provide the desired results for customers’ profitability or sustainability outcomes, impacting our competitive \nposition. \nWe may be unable to accurately forecast customer demand for products and services, and to adequately manage inventory, which \ncould adversely affect our operating results. \nTo ensure adequate inventory supply, we must forecast inventory needs and expenses and place orders sufficiently in advance with \nsuppliers and contract manufacturers. These forecasts are based on estimates of future demand for products and services. Failure to \naccurately forecast our needs may result in unmet market demand, parts shortages, manufacturing delays or inefficiencies, increased \ncosts, or excess inventory, such as what we experienced in fiscal year 2022 due to supply chain disruptions. Our ability to accurately \nforecast demand could be affected by many factors, including changes in customer demand for our products and services, changes in \n18 \ndemand for the products and services of competitors, unanticipated changes in general market conditions, and the weakening of \neconomic conditions or customer confidence in future economic conditions. If the forecasts used to manage inventory are not \naccurate, we may experience excess inventory levels, shortage of available products, or reduced manufacturing efficiencies. \nWe rely on a network of independent dealers to manage the distribution of our products and services. If our dealers are unsuccessful \nwith their sales and business operations, it could have an adverse effect on our overall sales and revenue. \nWe rely on the capability of our dealers to develop and implement effective sales plans to create demand among purchasers for the \nequipment and related products and services that dealers purchase from us. If our dealers are unsuccessful in these endeavors, we will \nbe unable to grow our sales and revenue, which would have an adverse effect on our financial condition. \nOur dealers carry inventories of finished products as part of their operations and adjust those inventories based on future needs and \nmarket conditions, including the level of used equipment inventory. If the inventory levels of our dealers are higher than they desire, \nthey may postpone equipment purchases from us, which could cause our sales to be lower and negatively impact our results. Similarly, \nour results could be negatively impacted through the loss of time-sensitive sales if our dealers do not maintain inventory levels \nsufficient to meet customer demand. \nIn addition, the dealer channel’s ability to support and service precision technology solutions and emerging power solutions may affect \ncustomers’ acceptance and adoption rates of these products. The unavailability of specialized technicians to service our equipment \nmay result in overburdening dealers’ servicing capacity. \nDealers may exit or we may seek to terminate relationships with certain dealers if they are unable to meet customer needs. The \nunplanned loss of any of our dealers could lead to inadequate market coverage or negative customer impressions, and may adversely \nimpact our ability to collect receivables that are associated with that dealer. Dealers could also have trouble funding their day-to-day \ncash flow needs and paying their obligations due to adverse business conditions resulting from negative economic effects or other \nfactors. \nWe may not realize anticipated benefits of acquisitions, joint ventures, and divestitures, or these benefits may take longer to realize \nthan expected. \nFrom time to time, we make strategic acquisitions and divestitures and participate in joint ventures. Acquisitions and joint ventures we \nhave entered into, or may enter into in the future, may involve significant challenges and risks, including that the acquisitions or joint \nventures do not advance our business strategy, or fail to produce satisfactory returns on investment. Other risks include: \n• We may encounter difficulties integrating acquisitions with our operations, applying internal control processes to these \nacquisitions, including those related to cybersecurity, managing strategic investments, assimilating new capabilities to meet \nthe future needs of our businesses, and/or combining business cultures; \n• We face regulatory or compliance exposure until appropriate processes and controls are put in place; \n• Integrating acquisitions is often costly and may require significant attention from management and personnel; \n• We may not realize all the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or joint ventures, or the realized benefits may be significantly \ndelayed; for example, our joint venture with Bradesco in Brazil with respect to Banco John Deere S.A. may not have the \nexpected result of reducing our incremental risk as we aim to grow in the Brazilian market; and \n• Due diligence evaluations of potential transactions include business, legal, compliance, and financial reviews with the goal of\nidentifying and evaluating the material risks involved. These due diligence reviews may not identify all of the issues necessary \nto accurately estimate the cost and potential risks of a particular acquisition or joint venture, including potential exposure to \nregulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target’s or joint venture partner’s previous activities or costs associated \nwith any quality issues with an acquisition target’s or joint venture’s products or services. \nWe may also decide to divest businesses and terminate joint ventures before their stated expiration. Divestitures of businesses or \ndissolutions of joint ventures may involve significant challenges and risks, including failure to advance our business strategy, costs and \ndisruptions to us, and negative effects on our product offerings, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and \nfinancial condition. Divestitures of businesses and dissolutions of joint ventures may result in ongoing financial or legal involvement in \nthe divested business through indemnifications or other financial arrangements, such as retained liabilities, which could affect our \nfuture financial results. \nOur reputation and brand could be damaged by negative publicity. \nOur brand has worldwide recognition and contributes to the success of our business. Our reputation is critical to growing our customer \nbase. Our brand depends on the ability to maintain a positive customer perception of the business. Negative claims or publicity\n19 \ninvolving us, our products or services, our culture and values, our stance on environmental, social, and governance topics, customer \ndata, or any of our key employees or suppliers, damages our reputation and brand image, regardless of whether such claims are \naccurate. Furthermore, our shareholders, customers, and other stakeholders have evolving, varied and often times conflicting \nexpectations regarding our culture, values, and our business, which makes it difficult to achieve a uniform positive perception amongst \nall stakeholders. \nAdditionally, negative or inaccurate postings, articles, or comments on social media, the internet, or the press about us have generated \nnegative publicity that damages the reputation of our brand. For example, in fiscal year 2024, we experienced negative social media \ncampaigns related to our approach to diversity and inclusion, our customers’ right to maintain and safely repair their equipment, \nincluding with respect to our Memorandum of Understanding with American Farm Bureau Federation, reductions in workforce, and \nproduction relocation. Further, adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us, or legal proceedings initiated by us, also \ndamages our reputation and brand image, undermining customer confidence, and reducing long-term demand for equipment, even if \nthe regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations. If the reputation, culture, or image of our brands are \ndamaged, or we receive negative publicity, then our sales, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and \nadversely affected. \nTALENT RISKS \nOur ability to attract, develop, engage, and retain qualified employees could affect our ability to execute our strategy. \nOur continued success depends, in part, on our ability to identify and attract qualified candidates with the requisite education, \nbackground, and experience, as well as our ability to develop, engage, and retain qualified employees. Failure to attract, develop, \nengage, and retain qualified employees, whether as a result of an insufficient number of qualified applicants, difficulty in recruiting \nnew employees, or inadequate resources to train, integrate, and retain qualified employees, could impair our ability to execute our \nbusiness strategy and could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \nIn addition, our culture and our values have been important contributors to our success to date and promote a sense of pride and \nfulfillment in our employees. Failure to preserve our culture or focus on our values could negatively affect our ability to retain and \nrecruit talent. \nWhile we strive to reduce the impact of the departure of employees, our operations or ability to execute our business strategy may be \naffected by the loss of employees, such as in connection with the reduction in workforce we conducted in fiscal year 2024. This\nreduction may adversely affect us as a result of decreased employee morale, the loss of institutional knowledge held by departing \nemployees, the allocation of resources to reorganize and reassign job roles and responsibilities, and the increased risk of litigation from \nformer employees. In addition, we may not realize the expected cost savings from the reduction in workforce. We may also conduct \nother workforce reductions in the future, if deemed appropriate for our business. \nDisputes with labor unions may adversely affect our ability to operate in our facilities as well as impact our financial results. \nMany of our production and maintenance employees are represented by labor unions under various collective bargaining agreements\nwith different expiration dates. Our failure to successfully renegotiate labor agreements as they expire has from time to time led, and \ncould in the future lead, to work stoppages or other disputes with labor unions. Certain of our labor agreements expire as early as \n2025. Disruptions to our manufacturing and parts-distribution facilities through various forms of labor disputes could adversely affect \nus. Any strike, work stoppage, or other dispute with a labor union distracts management from operating the business, may displace \nemployees from ordinary job positions to fill in vacant positions, may affect our reputation, and could materially adversely affect our \nbusiness, results of operations, and financial condition. \nDIGITAL RISKS \nSecurity breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations and could \ncompromise our information as well as information of our employees, customers, suppliers, and/or dealers, exposing us to liability that \ncould cause our business and reputation to suffer. \nIn the ordinary course of business, we rely upon information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third \nparties, to process, transmit, and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, \nincluding supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing, and collection of payments from dealers and other purchasers of our \nequipment and from customers of the financial services segment. We use information technology systems to record, process, and \nsummarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial \nreporting, legal, and tax requirements. \nAdditionally, we collect and store confidential data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, and the \nproprietary business information of our customers, suppliers, and dealers, as well as personal data of our customers and employees in \n20 \ndata centers, which are often owned by third parties and maintained on their information technology networks. The secure operation \nof these information technology networks, and the processing and maintenance of this information, are critical to our business \noperations and strategy. \nDespite security measures, including exercises, tests, incident simulations, and system assessments designed to discover and address \npotential vulnerabilities, our information technology networks and infrastructure have been and may be vulnerable to intrusion,\ndamage, disruptions, or shutdowns due to attacks by cyber criminals, employees’, suppliers’, or dealers’ error or malfeasance, supply \nchain compromise, disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware, power outages, \ncomputer viruses, ransomware or other malware, telecommunication or utility failures, terrorist acts, natural disasters, or other events. \nAlthough we have not suffered any significant cyber incidents that resulted in material business impact, we have from time to time \nbeen, and expect to continue to be, the target of malicious cyber threat actors. The occurrence of any significant event could \ncompromise our networks, and the information stored there could be accessed, obtained, publicly disclosed, lost, altered, misused, or \nstolen. Any such access, acquisition, disclosure, alteration, misuse, or other loss of information could result in legal claims or \nproceedings, government investigations, liability or regulatory penalties, disruption or shut down of our operations, disruption or shut \ndown of our dealers’ and customers’ operations, and damage to our reputation, which could adversely affect our business, results of \noperations, and financial condition. Furthermore, as security threats continue to evolve and increase in frequency and sophistication, \nwe may need to invest additional resources to enhance information security. \nAny unauthorized control or manipulation of our products’ systems could result in loss of confidence in us and our products. \nSome of our products include connectivity hardware and software typically used for remote system updates. While we have \nimplemented security measures intended to protect against unauthorized remote access to these products, malicious threat actors\nhave attempted, and may attempt in the future, to gain unauthorized access to such products in order to gain control of the products, \nchange the products’ functionality, user interface, or performance characteristics, interfere with the products’ operations, or gain \naccess to data stored in or generated by the products or to systems to which they connect. In addition, reports of unauthorized access \nto our products, systems, and data, regardless of their reliability, may result in the perception that the products, systems, or data are \nvulnerable to malicious or unauthorized modifications. Any unauthorized access to or control of our products or systems, any loss of \ndata, or any perception that products, systems, or data are vulnerable could result in loss of sales based on customers’ loss of \nconfidence in our products, legal claims or proceedings against us, government investigation, liability, or regulatory penalties, which \ncould adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \nTechnical or regulatory limitations may impact our ability to effectively implement automation, autonomy, and artificial intelligence \nsolutions. \nWe utilize automation and machine learning in some of our products, including consumer-facing features, and leverage generative\nartificial intelligence in our business processes. For example, the automation software, digital tools, applications, and analytics utilized \nin John Deere’s products are designed to improve customer decision-making, such as the automation package on the S7 Series \nCombines and the computer vision and machine learning technology that enables our See & Spray™ targeted spraying solution. \nWhile', url='https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/315189/000155837025000116/de-20241027xars.pdf'), ExaOutput(text='ee\ncad\n~O\nZa\nzw\naad\n\n2024\n\n\nDELIVERING WHAT’S NEXT. AS ONE. \nOne team. One vision. One FedEx.\nTo our FedEx stockholders,\nLast year, FedEx celebrated 50 years of transforming the world by connecting people and possibilities. This year, we continued \nto advance our mission by ushering in a new era as one FedEx. FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, and FedEx Services are now one \ncompany: Federal Express Corporation. \nThis foundational change to our internal structure improves efficiency and reduces cost, allowing our teams to move with even \ngreater speed and focus.\nThe world is rapidly changing, and we are evolving to help our customers compete and win with the world’s smartest \ntransportation and logistics network. Our structure is new, but our spirit is the same — ready and eager to embrace a new day as \none team united in purpose and promise to deliver what’s next.\nAs I reflect on the past year and the challenging demand environment, I am extremely proud of how the FedEx team delivered. \nThis year has shown the true embodiment of our People-Service-Profit culture.\nThrough continued focus on revenue quality and disciplined execution, FedEx achieved year-over-year operating profit and \nmargin expansion in every quarter of FY24. We lowered our capital intensity, reaching our FY25 target of less than 6.5% CapEx as \na percentage of revenue a year early; and with more efficient operations, we returned nearly $4 billion to stockholders through \ndividends and stock repurchases.\nIn FY25 we aim to build upon our momentum to create a brighter and more connected future for our customers, team members, \nand communities.\nChanging the way we work with DRIVE\nDRIVE is a framework that enables us to see beyond our current state and explore new perspectives, possibilities, and \napproaches. It has created a rigor that allows us to consistently execute at a high level and rapidly adapt to changing market \nconditions. We achieved our target of $1.8 billion in structural cost-out in FY24.\nOur performance through each and every quarter of FY24 shows the resiliency we are building into our business model. Looking \nahead, we are firmly on track to achieve our target of $4 billion of savings in FY25 compared to the FY23 baseline, as DRIVE \nevolves from a targeted transformation effort to being the foundational framework for how we work.\nWinning with digital \nInnovation has always been a part of the FedEx DNA. When FedEx founder, Frederick W. Smith, declared over 40 years ago that \nthe information about the package was as important as the package itself, it led to the development of the first system for \ncustomers to track their packages. Today, we are innovating with digital to make supply chains smarter for everyone.\nThe role of supply chains has fundamentally evolved in recent years. What was once a footnote in boardroom discussions has \nbecome a strategic imperative for business leaders across the globe.\nThe FedEx network has unique visibility into a world that connects millions of shippers with hundreds of millions of recipients, \nexchanging trillions of dollars of goods every year. We are using this data to reimagine our networks and offer better value \npropositions for our customers.\nWe are already seeing benefits of our digital solutions. For example, our new weather contingency playbook leverages predictive \ncapabilities to proactively divert storm-bound volumes across our networks. By combining the power of digital insights and \npredictive analytics with our physical network, we effectively mitigated the impact of the January 2024 winter storm that hit \nour Express hub in Memphis by shifting Memphis-bound Express volume to Ground or Freight at the origin location. Despite this \nyear’s event having a longer impact on Memphis operations compared to a similar weather event in 2023, our network recovered \ntwice as fast.\nAs our digital platform continues to grow, we will create even greater operational flexibility and efficiency for our customers and \nfor our own enterprise.\n2024 Annual Report 1\nReimagining the future\nI want to express my sincere gratitude to both Rob Carter and Mark Allen for their remarkable careers in light of their upcoming \nretirements. Rob has been a part of FedEx for the last 31 years, serving as CIO for the last 24 years, where he led FedEx in \nmodernizing our IT infrastructure. I’m immensely grateful to Rob for his numerous contributions in establishing FedEx as an \ninnovative, data-driven and a people-focused company. We thank him for his dedication and service to FedEx over the years. \nMark has had a distinguished 42-year career with the company. He was named to his current role in 2017 and was a key member \nof the leadership team as we navigated the unprecedented challenges of a global pandemic, uncertain economy, and a wide \nvariety of critical issues. His leadership and steady guidance of the legal, regulatory, governmental affairs, and security teams \nthrough an evolving landscape has helped lay the groundwork for a strong future as one FedEx. We wish Rob, Mark, and their \nfamilies health and happiness in their next chapters.\nThis is one of the most pivotal moments in FedEx history. We have the right team and the right strategy to achieve our long-term \nfinancial goals, and I have never been more confident in our direction. \nWe have a long runway of value creation opportunities in front of us as we continue to win profitable share, reimagine our \nnetwork, and harness the power of the data we generate moving 15 million packages globally each day. \nI am excited about the opportunities ahead as we continue to focus on enhancing our profitability and stockholder returns, while \nproviding outstanding service for our customers. And we are doing this the right way, with an utmost focus on safety, using our \nnetworks for good, and building towards a more sustainable future.\nWe are writing a new chapter for FedEx, and we will get there through our incredible culture and people – who always deliver and \ninspire what’s next.\nSincerely,\nRAJ SUBRAMANIAM\nPresident & CEO, FedEx Corporation\nSee “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” on pages 24-37 of the FY24 FedEx Corporation Annual Report on Form 10-K, \nincluded herein, for a discussion of potential risks and uncertainties that could materially affect our future performance.\n2\nDelivering What’s Next.

BUSINESS \nOverview \nFedEx Corporation (“FedEx”) was incorporated in Delaware on October 2, 1997 to serve as the parent holding company and provide \nstrategic direction to the FedEx portfolio of companies. FedEx provides customers and businesses worldwide with a broad portfolio of \ntransportation, e-commerce, and business services, offering integrated business solutions utilizing its flexible, efficient, and intelligent \nglobal network.\nOur website is located at fedex.com. Detailed information about our services, e-commerce tools and solutions, and environmental, \nsocial, and governance (“ESG”) initiatives can be found on our website. In addition, we make our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, \nQuarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and all exhibits and amendments to such reports available, free of \ncharge, through our website, as soon as reasonably practicable on the day they are filed with or furnished to the SEC. The Investor \nRelations page of our website, investors.fedex.com, contains a significant amount of information about FedEx, including our SEC \nfilings and financial and other information for investors. The information that we post on the Investor Relations page of our website \ncould be deemed to be material information. We encourage investors, the media, and others interested in FedEx to visit this website \nfrom time to time, as information is updated and new information is posted. The information on our website, however, is not \nincorporated by reference in, and does not form part of, this Annual Report. Except as otherwise specified, any reference to a year in \nthis Annual Report indicates our fiscal year ended May 31 of the year referenced.\nOne FedEx Consolidation and New Reportable Segments\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, we announced one FedEx, a consolidation plan to bring FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. (“FedEx \nGround”) and FedEx Corporate Services, Inc. (“FedEx Services”) into Federal Express Corporation (“Federal Express”), becoming a \nsingle company operating a unified, fully integrated air-ground express network under the respected FedEx brand. On June 1, 2024, \nFedEx Ground and FedEx Services were merged into Federal Express. FedEx Freight, Inc. (“FedEx Freight”) continues to provide \nless-than-truckload (“LTL”) freight transportation services as a separate subsidiary. Beginning in the first quarter of 2025, Federal \nExpress and FedEx Freight will represent our major service lines and constitute our reportable segments. FedEx Custom Critical, Inc. \n(“FedEx Custom Critical”) will be included in the FedEx Freight segment instead of the Federal Express segment beginning in 2025.\nAdditionally, the FedEx Dataworks, Inc. (“FedEx Dataworks”) operating segment is focused on creating solutions to transform the \ndigital and physical experiences of our customers and team members. The FedEx Office and Print Services, Inc. (“FedEx Office”) \noperating segment provides document and business services and retail access to our package transportation businesses and the FedEx \nLogistics, Inc. (“FedEx Logistics”) operating segment provides customs brokerage and global ocean and air freight forwarding, as \nwell as integrated supply chain management solutions through FedEx Supply Chain Distribution System, Inc. (“FedEx Supply \nChain”). FedEx Dataworks, FedEx Office, and FedEx Logistics are included in “Corporate, other, and eliminations” in our segment \nreporting. There will be no changes to “Corporate, other, and eliminations” in 2025 following the one FedEx consolidation. For more \ninformation about FedEx Dataworks, FedEx Office, and FedEx Logistics, please see “FedEx Dataworks Operating Segment,” “FedEx \nOffice Operating Segment,” and “FedEx Logistics Operating Segment” under “Business Segments” below. For more information \nabout our new reportable segments beginning in the first quarter of 2025, please see “Business Segments” below. \nDuring 2024 and 2023, our reportable segments were FedEx Express, the world’s largest express transportation company; FedEx \nGround, a leading North American provider of small-package ground delivery services; FedEx Freight Corporation, a leading North \nAmerican provider of LTL freight transportation services; and FedEx Services, which provided sales, marketing, information \ntechnology, communications, customer service, technical support, billing and collection services, and certain back-office functions \nthat supported our operating segments. For financial information concerning our reportable segments in place during 2024 and 2023, \nrefer to “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” and “Item 8. Financial \nStatements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report. Part I of this Annual Report contains certain references to the financial \nand operational performance of our reportable segments in place during 2024 and 2023. Additional information regarding our \nreportable segments in place during 2024 and 2023 can be found in “Item 1. Business” and “Item 2. Properties” of our Annual Report \nfor the year ended May 31, 2023. Certain statistical information in Part I of this Annual Report is presented as of June 7, 2024, the \nearliest practicable date following the one FedEx consolidation.\nStrategy \nThe collective FedEx brand gives us our competitive edge. Further, our strategy allows us to manage our business as a portfolio, in the \nlong-term best interest of the enterprise. As a result, we base decisions on capital investment and service additions or enhancements \nupon achieving the highest overall long-term return on invested capital for our business as a whole. We focus on making appropriate \n- 3 -\ninvestments in the technology and assets necessary to optimize our long-term earnings performance and cash flow. Our business \nstrategy also provides flexibility in structuring our network to align with varying macroeconomic conditions and customer demand for \nthe market segments in which the customer operates, allowing us to leverage and manage change. Volatility, uncertainty, and \ninnovation have become the norms in the global transportation market, and we are able to use our flexibility to accommodate changing \nconditions in the global economy.\nFor more than 50 years, we built networks that have created a differentiated and unmatched portfolio of services while continuously \nevolving to meet the changing needs of our customers and the market. With the recent significant growth of e-commerce and as our \nservice mix continues to shift to deferred services, we are continuing to evolve to improve our operational efficiency and enhance \nprofitability through one FedEx, Network 2.0 (our multi-year effort to improve the efficiency with which FedEx picks up, transports, \nand delivers packages in the U.S. and Canada), and DRIVE (our comprehensive program to improve long-term profitability). We are \nbuilding a simplified experience to better serve our customers with enhanced capabilities and transforming to operate with more \nflexibility, efficiency, and intelligence. \nWe have implemented Network 2.0 in more than 50 locations in the U.S. and began the phased transition of all legacy FedEx Ground \noperations and personnel in Canada to Federal Express surface operations in April 2024. As we optimize our network under Network \n2.0, Federal Express will continue to utilize both employee couriers and contracted service providers in U.S. surface operations using \na market-by-market approach. Additionally, in 2024 we announced Tricolor, the redesign of the Federal Express international air \nnetwork as part of the DRIVE program to improve efficiency and asset utilization. See “Business Segments” below, “Item 1A. Risk \nFactors,” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” of this Annual \nReport for more information on one FedEx, Network 2.0, and DRIVE. One FedEx and Network 2.0 will leverage the strength of our \nnetworks, people, and assets in more efficient ways, enabling a distinct focus on air and international volume while facilitating a more \nholistic approach to how we move packages on the ground. \nInnovation inspired our start at FedEx over 50 years ago, and it is fueling our future as we combine logistics with digital intelligence. \nLeveraging the capabilities of FedEx Dataworks, developments in data and technology, including artificial intelligence and machine \nlearning, are facilitating the execution of our DRIVE transformation by creating new opportunities to improve our operational \nefficiency. See “Business Segments” below for more information. The size and scale of our global network gives us key insights into \nglobal supply chains and trends. This foundation provides an immense amount of data we can use to build better insights, improve the \ncustomer experience, and differentiate our service offerings. To fully harness the power of this data, FedEx Dataworks is focused on \nputting our data into context and using it to enhance the efficiency of the FedEx network and the end-to-end experience of our \ncustomers by making supply chains smarter for everyone. \nIn January 2024, we announced fdx, a fully integrated data-driven commerce platform that connects the entire customer journey. See \n“Federal Express Segment — Customer-Driven Technology — E-Commerce and Digital Solutions” below for more information. In \nearly 2025 we formed a new enterprise-wide Data & Technology team, which is focused on initiatives to streamline the technology \nused during the package delivery lifecycle; establish global standards across pickup-and-delivery, linehaul, sort, and clearance \noperations; and improve digital products and experiences for the FedEx enterprise and our customers.\n“Safety Above All” is the first and foremost value in every aspect of our business. We are committed to making our workplaces and \ncommunities safer for our team members, customers, and the public. This philosophy is embedded in our day-to-day work through \nrigorous policies, continual education and engagement, and investments in technology designed to prevent accidents.\nThrough our global transportation, information technology, and retail networks, we help to facilitate an ongoing and unprecedented \nexpansion of customer access — to goods, services, and information. We believe it would be extremely difficult, costly, and time\x02consuming to replicate our global network, which reflects decades of investment, innovation, and expertise, includes the world’s \nlargest all-cargo air fleet, and connects more than 99% of the world’s gross domestic product. We continue to position our company \nand team members to facilitate and capitalize on this access and to achieve stronger long-term growth, productivity, and profitability.\nDuring 2024 and early 2025, we introduced and expanded a number of innovative solutions, advanced important long-term business \ninitiatives, and made other important investments that benefit our customers, team members, communities, and other stakeholders, \nincluding:\n• Completing our one FedEx consolidation plan to bring FedEx Ground and FedEx Services into Federal Express, becoming a single \ncompany operating a unified, fully integrated air-ground express network.\n• Continuing DRIVE, our comprehensive program to improve our long-term profitability. \n• Implementing Network 2.0 in more than 50 locations in the U.S. and beginning the phased implementation in Canada. \n- 4 -\n• Announcing Tricolor, the redesign of the Federal Express international air network to improve efficiency and asset utilization of the \nentire FedEx system. \n• Introducing fdx, a fully integrated data-driven commerce platform that connects the entire customer journey.\n• Opening our first Advanced Capability Community in India, which will create employment opportunities and help meet the \ntechnological and digital requirements of FedEx operations worldwide.\n• Further strengthening our customer offerings through digital and data-driven solutions, such as enhancements to our healthcare \nservices with more powerful capabilities to prioritize critical shipments and provide monitoring and intervention.\n• Leveraging the power of our digital insights and predictive capabilities through FedEx Dataworks to proactively divert storm\x02bound volumes across our networks during severe winter weather in the third quarter of 2024. \nIn June 2024, we announced that FedEx’s management and Board of Directors are conducting an assessment of the role of FedEx \nFreight in the company’s portfolio structure. \nBusiness Segments \nThe following describes in more detail the operations of each of our principal operating segments beginning in the first quarter of \n2025: \nFederal Express Segment \nOverview \nFederal Express pioneered the express transportation industry over 50 years ago in 1973 and remains the industry leader today, \nproviding a range of rapid, reliable, time- and day-definite delivery services to more than 220 countries and territories through an \nintegrated air-ground express network. In connection with our one FedEx consolidation, on June 1, 2024 FedEx Ground and FedEx \nServices were merged into Federal Express. \nAs of June 7, 2024, Federal Express employed approximately 430,000 employees and had approximately 64,000 drop-off locations \n(including FedEx Office stores and FedEx OnSite locations, such as nearly 17,000 Walgreens, Dollar General, and Albertsons stores), \nnearly 700 aircraft, and over 175,000 motorized vehicles in its global network. Federal Express contracts with approximately 6,000 \nindependent small businesses to conduct certain linehaul and pickup-and-delivery operations. See “Operations” below for information \nregarding the consolidation of these operations into the surface operations of Federal Express. Federal Express also provides cross\x02border enablement and technology solutions and e-commerce transportation solutions.\nU.S. and Canadian Services \nFederal Express offers a wide range of U.S. domestic and Canadian shipping services for delivery of packages and freight. Federal \nExpress offers three U.S. domestic overnight package delivery services: FedEx First Overnight, FedEx Priority Overnight, and FedEx \nStandard Overnight. FedEx SameDay service is available 365 days a year throughout all 50 states for urgent shipments up to 150 \npounds. Federal Express also offers U.S. express overnight and deferred freight services to handle the needs of the time-definite \nfreight market.\nFederal Express is also a leading provider of day-definite business and residential package delivery services for packages weighing up \nto 150 pounds. Federal Express service reaches 100% of the continental U.S. population and nearly 100% of the Canadian population. \nFederal Express offers residential delivery service to 99% of the U.S. population on Saturdays and more than half of the U.S. \npopulation on Sundays. Federal Express also offers an economy service that is available for the consolidation and delivery of high \nvolumes of low-weight, less time-sensitive business-to-consumer packages to any residential address or P.O. Box in the U.S. \nInternational Services\nFederal Express offers a wide range of international shipping services for delivery of packages and freight, connecting markets that \ngenerate more than 99% of the world’s gross domestic product. FedEx international package services include a money-back \nguarantee. Federal Express’s unmatched air route authorities and extensive transportation infrastructure, combined with leading-edge \ninformation technologies, make it the world’s largest express transportation company. \n- 5 -\nInternational express and deferred package delivery is available to more than 220 countries and territories, with a variety of time\x02definite services to meet distinct customer needs. FedEx International Economy provides time-definite delivery typically in two to five \nbusiness days. FedEx International First provides time-definite delivery to select postal codes in more than 25 countries and territories, \nwith delivery to select U.S. ZIP Codes as early as 8:00 a.m. from more than 90 countries and Caribbean islands in one or two business \ndays, delivery by 10:00 a.m. in one business day from the U.S. to Canada, and by 11:00 a.m. in one business day from the U.S. to \nMexico. Federal Express also offers domestic pickup-and-delivery services within certain non-U.S. countries, including France, the \nUnited Kingdom, Australia, Brazil, Italy, Canada, Mexico, Poland, India, China, and South Africa. In addition, Federal Express offers \ncomprehensive international express and deferred freight services, real-time tracking, and advanced customs clearance.\nOur FedEx International Priority service provides end-of-day time-definite delivery in one to three business days to more than 220 \ncountries and territories, and our FedEx International Priority Express service provides midday time-definite delivery in one to three \nbusiness days to more than 25 countries and territories. Additionally, FedEx International Connect Plus, a contractual e-commerce \nservice currently available from nearly 60 origin countries to over 190 destination countries, provides day-definite delivery typically \nwithin two to five business days.\nOperations\nFederal Express’s largest sorting facility, located in Memphis, serves as the center of the company’s multiple hub-and-spoke system \nand worldwide air network. A second national air hub facility is located in Indianapolis. We are making investments over multiple \nyears in our facilities to expand and modernize our Indianapolis hub and modernize our Memphis hub. See the “Financial Condition \n— Liquidity Outlook” section of “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” \nof this Annual Report for more information. In addition to these national air hubs, Federal Express operates regional air hubs in Fort \nWorth, Newark, Oakland, and Greensboro and major metropolitan sorting facilities at airports in Chicago, Los Angeles, and Atlanta. \nFacilities at airports in Anchorage, Paris, Cologne, Guangzhou, and Osaka serve as sorting facilities for express package and freight \ntraffic moving to and from Asia, Europe, and North America. Additional major sorting and freight handling facilities are located at \nNarita Airport in Tokyo and Stansted Airport outside London. The facilities in Paris, Cologne, Guangzhou, and Osaka are also \ndesigned to serve as regional air hubs for their respective market areas. A facility in Miami serves our South Florida, Latin American, \nand Caribbean markets. A central air hub near Liege, Belgium connects specific large European markets. In addition to its worldwide \nair network, Federal Express operates road networks in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Australia, and South America. \nFederal Express’s unique European road network connects more than 45 countries and territories through 28 transit hubs and more \nthan 600 stations. \nWith the recent significant growth of e-commerce and as our service mix continues to shift to deferred services, we are fundamentally \nredesigning our international air network in connection with our DRIVE transformation program. The redesigned network will \ncontinue to deploy FedEx-owned aircraft in the delivery of International Priority parcel shipments using our existing hub-and-spoke \nmodel. Additionally, a portion of our owned aircraft fleet will be retimed to operate off-cycle, allowing us to build density, decongest \nhubs, and connect our global surface networks. Finally, we will continue to leverage our global partner network as an adaptive \ncapacity layer, particularly on imbalanced trade lanes, to move e-commerce and deferred volumes.\nThroughout its worldwide network, Federal Express operates city stations and employs a staff of customer service agents, cargo \nhandlers, and couriers who pick up and deliver shipments in the station’s service area. In some international areas, independent agents \n(“Global Service Participants”) have been selected to complete deliveries and to pick up packages. For more information about our \nsorting and handling facilities, see “Item 2. Properties” of this Annual Report under the caption “Federal Express Segment.” \nFederal Express also operates a highly flexible surface network of over 700 legacy FedEx Ground sortation and distribution facilities, \nincluding 165 fully automated stations, as of June 7, 2024. Federal Express conducts these operations in the U.S. primarily with more \nthan 95,000 motorized vehicles owned or leased by independent service providers. Through Network 2.0, the multi-year effort to \nimprove the efficiency with which we pick up, transport, and deliver packages in the U.S. and Canada, these operations are being \nconsolidated into the surface operations of Federal Express. We have implemented Network 2.0 in more than 50 locations in the U.S. \nand began the phased transition of all legacy FedEx Ground operations and personnel in Canada to Federal Express surface operations \nin April 2024. Under Network 2.0, Federal Express will continue to utilize both its employee couriers and contracted service providers \nin U.S. surface operations using a market-by-market approach. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion \nand Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” of this Annual Report for more information on Network 2.0.\nFederal Express continues to maximize the use of existing U.S. surface facilities through Network 2.0. Many of these facilities utilize \nadvanced automated unloading and sorting technology to streamline the handling of millions of packages daily. This technology \nincludes a yard management system in many facilities which interacts with GPS tags on trailers to automatically notify the control \n- 6 -\ncenter when a trailer arrives and departs. Using overhead laser and six-sided camera-based bar code scan technology, hub conveyors \nelectronically guide packages to their appropriate destination chute where they are loaded for transport to their respective destination \nstations for local delivery. \nThrough collaboration with FedEx Dataworks, Federal Express is also implementing dynamic scheduling tools at many U.S. surface \nfacilities to match sort staffing with volumes and is introducing capabilities to allow certain packages to bypass station sortation and \nproceed directly to vehicles, which helps to maximize station capacity. In addition, dock modernization efforts enabled by FedEx \nDataworks, including a network operating plan that uses machine learning and algorithms to develop more detailed and accurate \nvolume forecasts, are enhancing productivity at these facilities in furtherance of our DRIVE initiatives. Federal Express is also testing \nautonomous, driverless technologies in the handling of large, non-conveyable packages, as well as artificial intelligence-enabled \nrobotic product sortation systems to sort small packages. During the third quarter of 2024, Federal Express leveraged the power of our \ndigital insights and predictive capabilities through FedEx Dataworks to proactively divert storm-bound volumes during severe winter \nweather. \nFederal Express offers service providers advanced route optimization technology supported by the capabilities of FedEx Dataworks \nthat includes near real-time data that service providers may use to plan efficient delivery routes and vehicle mix. To promote safe \noperations, service providers contracting with Federal Express agree to use certain safety-related vehicle technologies and satisfy \ncertain driver standards. Additionally, software systems and internet-based applications are deployed to offer customers new ways to \nconnect internal package data with external delivery information. In 2024 we introduced a new tool to Federal Express service \nproviders to track and drive improvement across key operating metrics tied to demand, safety, service, and productivity. Federal \nExpress provides shipment tracing and proof-of-delivery signature functionality through the FedEx website, fedex.com. For additional \ninformation regarding FedEx e-commerce tools and solutions, including FedEx Delivery Manager and FedEx Returns, see “Customer\x02Driven Technology — E-Commerce Solutions” below.\nPricing \nFederal Express periodically publishes updates to the list prices for the majority of its services in its Service Guides. In general, \nshipping rates are based on the service selected, origin, destination, weight, size, any ancillary service charge, and whether the \ncustomer charged the shipment to a FedEx account. On January 1, 2024, a 5.9% average list price increase was implemented in the \nU.S. for domestic and international services. List prices also increased for contractual services and in international markets at this \ntime.\nFederal Express implements and adjusts demand surcharges (previously known as peak surcharges) from time to time based on \nassessments of shipment volume and capacity in our network. For U.S. domestic services, demand surcharges historically have \napplied to shipments that are oversized, unauthorized, or require additional handling; to residential packages for customers meeting a \ncertain volume threshold; and to FedEx Ground Economy shipments. Demand surcharges on U.S. domestic services initially \nimplemented beginning in 2020 remained in effect for the first half of 2024. Higher surcharges were applied during the 2024 holiday \nshipping season, after which time the U.S. domestic demand surcharges were reduced or suspended. Demand surcharges on \ninternational services initially implemented beginning in 2020 were reduced for select lanes in September 2023, October 2023, and \nJanuary 2024 and remained in effect for the Middle East, Indian Subcontinent, and African region until June 3, 2024, and for all other \ninternational markets until April 29, 2024. \nFederal Express has an indexed fuel surcharge for U.S. domestic and U.S. outbound shipments and for shipments originating \ninternationally, where legally and contractually possible, which is adjusted on a weekly basis. The fuel surcharge is based on a weekly \nfuel price from roughly two weeks prior to the week in which it is assessed. Effective December 11, 2023 and May 6, 2024, the tables \nused to determine fuel surcharges for U.S. domestic services were updated. The tables used to determine fuel surcharges for \ninternational services were updated in November 2023. See the “Results of Operations and Outlook — Consolidated Results — Fuel” \nsection of “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” of this Annual Report \nfor more information. \nRetail Access Network\nFedEx Office offers retail access to Federal Express shipping services at all of its retail locations. Federal Express also has alliances \nwith certain other retailers to provide in-store drop-off sites, including at more than 19,000 Walgreens, Dollar General, and Albertsons \nstores. Our unstaffed FedEx Drop Boxes provide customers the opportunity to drop off packages in office buildings, shopping centers, \nand corporate or industrial parks. In total, Federal Express has approximately 64,000 drop-off locations.\n- 7 -\nU.S. Postal Service Agreement \nFederal Express’s agreement with the U.S. Postal Service (“USPS”) to provide airport-to-airport transportation of USPS First Class \nMail, Priority Mail Express, and Priority Mail within the U.S will expire by its terms on September 29, 2024. Federal Express will \ncontinue to provide air transportation services domestically and to Puerto Rico through the contract’s expiration. Federal Express also \nprovides transportation and delivery for the USPS’s international delivery service called Global Express Guaranteed under a separate \nagreement. For more information, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of \nOperations and Financial Condition” of this Annual Report. \nFuel Supplies and Costs \nDuring 2024, FedEx Express purchased jet fuel from various suppliers under contracts that vary in length and which provide for \nestimated amounts of fuel to be delivered. The fuel represented by these contracts is purchased at market prices. We do not have any \njet fuel hedging contracts. See “Pricing” above. \nThe following table sets forth FedEx Express’s costs for jet fuel and its percentage of FedEx Corporation consolidated revenues for \nthe last five fiscal years: \nFiscal Year\nTotal Jet\nFuel Cost\n(in millions)\nPercentage of \nConsolidated\nRevenue\n2024 $ 3,598 4.1%\n2023 4,515 5.0\n2022 3,867 4.1\n2021 2,065 2.5\n2020 2,265 3.3\nMost of Federal Express’s vehicle fuel needs are satisfied by retail purchases with various discounts. \nCompetition\nAs described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report, the U.S. domestic and international package and the U.S. domestic \nfreight and international freight markets are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service, especially in periods of little or \nno macroeconomic growth. The ability to compete effectively depends upon price, frequency, reliability, capacity and speed of \nscheduled service, ability to track packages, extent of geographic coverage, innovative service offerings, and the fit within the \ncustomer’s overall supply chain. \nCompetitors within the U.S. include other package delivery concerns, principally United Parcel Service, Inc. (“UPS”), passenger \nairlines offering express package services, regional delivery companies, air freight forwarders, and the USPS. Federal Express’s \nprincipal international competitors are DHL, UPS, DPD (a subsidiary of France’s La Poste’s GeoPost), General Logistics Systems (a \nRoyal Mail-owned parcel delivery group), foreign postal authorities, passenger airlines, air freight forwarders, regional carriers, and \nall-cargo airlines. Federal Express also competes with startup companies that combine technology with crowdsourcing to focus on \nlocal market needs. In addition, some high-volume package shippers, such as Amazon.com, are developing and implementing in\x02house delivery capabilities and utilizing independent contractors and delivery service providers for deliveries, and may be considered \ncompetitors. For example, Amazon.com has established a network of hubs, aircraft, and vehicles and has expressed an intention to \noffer its internal delivery capabilities broadly to third parties. Many of Federal Express’s international competitors are government\x02owned, -controlled, or -subsidized carriers, which may have greater resources, lower costs, less profit sensitivity, and more favorable \noperating conditions than Federal Express. For more information, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report.\nEmployees and Service Providers\nRajesh Subramaniam is the President and Chief Executive Officer of Federal Express, John A. Smith is the Chief Operating Officer – \nUnited States and Canada, and Richard W. Smith is the Chief Operating Officer – International and Chief Executive Officer – Airline. \nAs of June 7, 2024, Federal Express employed approximately 241,000 permanent full-time and approximately 189,000 permanent \npart-time employees. In addition, Federal Express contracts with approximately 6,000 independent small businesses to conduct certain \nlinehaul and pickup-and-delivery operations.\nThe pilots at Federal Express, who are a small number of its total employees, are represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, \nInternational (“ALPA”) and are employed under a collective bargaining agreement that took effect in November 2015. The collective \nbargaining agreement became amendable in November 2021. Bargaining for a successor agreement began in May 2021, and in \n- 8 -\nNovember 2022 the National Mediation Board (“NMB”) began actively mediating the negotiations. In July 2023, Federal Express’s \npilots failed to ratify the tentative successor agreement that was approved by ALPA’s FedEx Master Executive Council the prior \nmonth. Bargaining for a successor agreement continues. In April 2024, the NMB rejected ALPA’s request for a proffer of arbitration. \nFedEx will continue to bargain in good faith and the ongoing bargaining process has no effect on our operations. In addition to our \npilots, certain of FedEx’s non-U.S. employees are unionized. FedEx believes its employee relations are excellent. See “Item 1A. Risk \nFactors” of this Annual Report for more information. \nFederal Express, as successor to FedEx Ground, is defending against lawsuits in which it is alleged that Federal Express should be \ntreated as an employer or joint employer of drivers employed by service providers engaged by Federal Express. We continue to \nbelieve that Federal Express is not an employer or joint employer of the drivers of these independent businesses. The status of the \ndrivers employed by these service providers could be further challenged in connection with the recent one FedEx consolidation and \nNetwork 2.0. For information regarding these proceedings, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” of this \nAnnual Report and Note 20 of the consolidated financial statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary \nData” of this Annual Report.\nCustomer-Driven Technology \nFedEx is a world leader in technology, and FedEx founder Frederick W. Smith’s vision that “the information about a package is as \nimportant as the delivery of the package itself” remains at the core of our comprehensive technology strategy. We strive to build \ntechnology solutions that will solve our customers’ business problems with simplicity, convenience, speed, and reliability. \nAdditionally, FedEx stands at the nexus of digital and physical networks, a crucial intersection for the success of e-commerce \ndeliveries. We continue to expand our e-commerce convenience network and explore innovative alternatives to help customers and \nbusinesses deliver. During 2024 we continued to advance a major information technology transition from traditional mainframe \ncomputing to cloud-based systems, which is delivering significant benefits in terms of flexibility, security, speed to market, and \nresiliency. See “FedEx Dataworks Operating Segment” below for more information on the solutions we are creating to enhance the \nend-to-end experience of our customers by making supply chains smarter for everyone.\nShipping Management and Precision Tracking\nThe fedex.com website is widely recognized for its speed, ease of use, and customer-focused features. The advanced tracking \ncapability within FedEx Tracking provides customers with a consolidated view of inbound and outbound shipments. Additionally, an \nadvanced machine learning and artificial intelligence model developed by FedEx Dataworks has enhanced tracking capabilities on \nfedex.com, delivering greater estimated delivery date accuracy, including updates for early or delayed shipments. FedEx Virtual \nAssistant on fedex.com is an artificial-intelligence-enabled service that provides answers to customer shipping questions, allowing our \ncustomer service representatives and sales professionals to focus on higher-value customer interactions. \nSenseAware Mobile, a FedEx innovation currently available in over 130 countries worldwide, allows customers to stay connected to \ntheir critical shipments by providing real-time updates regarding current location, precise temperature, relative humidity, barometric \npressure readings, light exposure, shock events, tilt beyond a certain angle, and healthcare subsampling. Additionally, FedEx \nSenseAware ID is a lightweight sensor-based logistics device that delivers a new level of precision tracking. The enhanced location \nvisibility provided by FedEx SenseAware ID is creating opportunities for FedEx customers to reimagine their supply chains through \nreal-time updates on a package’s location within the Federal Express network. FedEx is currently expanding access to FedEx \nSenseAware ID and plans to eventually make FedEx SenseAware ID available for a broad range of premium Federal Express services.\nFedEx Mobile is a suite of solutions including the FedEx mobile application, FedEx mobile website, and SMS text messaging. The \nFedEx Mobile app provides convenience for recipients to track packages and access FedEx Delivery Manager to customize home \ndeliveries. Shippers can easily get rates and estimated delivery times and swiftly create a shipping label. All users can quickly find the \nnearest FedEx location for Hold at Location or drop-off. It is available on Android™ and Apple devices. The FedEx Mobile app has \nexpanded to more than 220 countries and territories and 40 languages. \nFedEx Surround Select is a visibility platform that allows customers to view and manage shipments in one place. The tool provides \nglobal visibility into shipments with package-level insights in near real-time. Advanced features include predictive delay notifications, \nweather advisories, and customizable views and reports. \nIn 2023, FedEx announced the launch of Picture Proof of Delivery for express and ground residential deliveries in the U.S. and \nCanada that are released without a signature. The capability has since expanded to 60 countries globally.\nAdditionally, our FedEx Ship Manager suite of solutions offers a wide range of options to help our customers manage their parcel and \nLTL shipping and associated processes. \n- 9 -\nE-Commerce and Digital Solutions\nFedEx Delivery Manager allows our U.S. residential customers to customize home deliveries to fit their schedule by providing a range \nof options to schedule dates, locations, and times of delivery. Additionally, FedEx Returns Technology, a comprehensive solution for \nreturns management, provides high-volume merchants and e-tailers complete visibility into returns and an easy way to track \nshipments, manage inventory, analyze returns trends, and make more informed decisions based on shoppers’ returns behaviors. In \n2023 we launched FedEx Consolidated Returns in the U.S., a low-priced, easy e-commerce solution for low-weight returns facilitated \nthrough supply chain services offered by FedEx Supply Chain and FedEx Office. Through FedEx Consolidated Returns, shoppers who \npurchased from participating merchants can drop off the items they wish to return with no box or label required at approximately \n2,000 FedEx Office locations. The returned items will then be consolidated with other returns and processed through FedEx Supply \nChain and sent back to the merchants via an LTL option.\nThe FedEx retail convenience network also utilizes third-party retailers to receive and hold packages for FedEx customers. The U.S. \nretail convenience network has grown to include nearly 17,000 Walgreens, Dollar General, and Albertsons stores in addition to our \napproximately 2,000 FedEx Office locations and over 600 FedEx Ship Centers. In addition to allowing for an easy returns and drop\x02off experience for shoppers, the retail convenience network is well positioned to serve as a “buy online, pickup in store” network for \nsmall and medium merchants without brick-and-mortar locations. We have also added FedEx Returns Technology at Walgreens \nlocations, which allows for in-store printing of return shipping labels and eliminates the need to include a return label in every \npackage. Additionally, FedEx offers drop off and sold shipping services at nearly 1,000 Office Depot and Office Max locations and \nover 4,000 FedEx Authorized Ship Centers. \nWe have expanded e-commerce delivery options for retailers with FedEx Extra Hours, a service that enables participating retailers to \nfulfill e-commerce orders into the evening and receive late pickups by Federal Express, with next-day local delivery and two-day \nshipping to any address in the continental U.S. FedEx Extra Hours, which is currently available to select customers, allows retailers to \nextend evening order cutoff times by five to eight hours, with some as late as midnight, depending on their current order fulfillment \nprocess.\nIn January 2024, FedEx announced fdx, a fully integrated data-driven commerce platform that connects the entire customer journey. \nEnabled by FedEx Dataworks and by providing data and insights that improve visibility and connected capabilities across the \ncustomer journey, fdx will help merchants make more strategic logistics decisions from point of demand to delivery and returns. The \nfdx platform is currently available as a private preview upon request, with the official launch planned for the second quarter of 2025.\nMy FedEx Rewards allows businesses in the U.S. to earn rewards for their loyalty in shipping and printing with FedEx.\nThrough innovative partnerships, FedEx Dataworks seeks to open pathways to e-commerce and empower customers with \ndifferentiated insights and tools. In 2022, we announced a multi-year partnership with Salesforce that integrates Salesforce Commerce \nCloud and Salesforce Order Management with innovative capabilities from FedEx and ShopRunner. We will leverage our relationship \nwith Salesforce to pursue additional innovations and provide customers a more informed, efficient, and personalized FedEx \nexperience. Additionally, in 2023 FedEx and FourKites announced a strategic alliance to provide businesses with new, more robust \nreal-time supply chain visibility capabilities. In 2023, we also announced a strategic alliance with Cart.com to create integrated \nsolutions that help address some of the biggest e-commerce challenges.\nShopRunner is a consumer membership program that provides benefits such as easy order tracking at hundreds of retailers, free two\x02day shipping and returns, and other benefits. \nSee “The Environment” below for information about our FedEx® Sustainability Insights tool, which gives customers and suppliers \naccess to estimated CO2e emission data associated with FedEx shipments.\nAutonomous Solutions\nFedEx is exploring the use of autonomous delivery technology within its operations. In 2022, we announced a multi-year, multi-phase \nagreement to test Nuro’s next-generation autonomous delivery vehicle within FedEx operations. The collaboration with Nuro will \nexplore various use cases for on-road autonomous vehicle logistics such as multi-stop and appointment-based deliveries. \nIn 2022, we began a pilot program with Aurora Innovation, Inc. (“Aurora”) and PACCAR Inc. (“PACCAR”) to test Aurora’s \nautonomous driving technology in PACCAR autonomous vehicle platform-equipped trucks within FedEx linehaul operations. \nAdditionally, Federal Express is developing plans to test Elroy Air’s autonomous air cargo system within the company’s middle-mile \nlogistics operations, moving shipments between sortation locations. \n- 10 -\nMarketing\nThe FedEx brand name symbolizes outstanding service, reliability, and speed.

Lance D. Moll is the President of FedEx Freight, which is based in \nMemphis, Tennessee. FedEx Freight’s primary competitors are XPO Logistics, Inc., Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc., ABF Freight \n(an ArcBest company), SAIA, Inc., and TFI International Inc. In connection with the one FedEx consolidation, FedEx Freight \nCorporation merged into FedEx Freight on June 1, 2024. We are currently bargaining with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters \nat one FedEx Freight facility. \nIn June 2024, we announced that FedEx’s management and Board of Directors are conducting an assessment of the role of FedEx \nFreight in the company’s portfolio structure. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Strategic Risks — Our ongoing assessment of the role of \nFedEx Freight in our portfolio structure may not result in any consummated transaction or other outcome and could adversely affect \nour business, and there is no guarantee that any transaction resulting from the assessment will ultimately benefit our stockholders” for \nmore information.\nPricing\nFedEx Freight periodically publishes updates to the list prices for the majority of its services in its 100 Rules Tariff. In general, \nshipping rates are based on the service selected, origin, destination, weight, class, any ancillary service charge, and whether the \ncustomer charged the shipment to a FedEx account. On January 1, 2024, FedEx Freight implemented a 5.9% average list price \nincrease for customers who use FXF PZONE and FXF EZONE rates and a 6.9% average list price increase for customers who use \nFXF 1000 and FXF 501. These increases apply for shipments within the U.S. and between the contiguous U.S. and Canada. \nFedEx Freight implements and adjusts demand surcharges from time-to-time based on assessments of shipment volume and capacity \nin our network. Beginning in July 2021 FedEx Freight implemented a demand peak surcharge applying to specific delivery points \nwithin the U.S. The demand peak surcharge has been adjusted periodically since implementation. Effective November 15, 2021, \nFedEx Freight increased applicable length surcharges. Effective January 17, 2022, FedEx Freight added a surcharge that applies when \na pickup is performed and no shipment is tendered to the carrier. Effective January 16, 2023, FedEx Freight changed the extreme \nlength surcharge to a tier-based length structure. The company continues to explore ways to modernize freight pricing including \nthrough dimension-in-motion technology, which more accurately captures freight profile and improves its ability to cost and price \nshipments.\nFedEx Freight has an indexed fuel surcharge, which is adjusted on a weekly basis. The fuel surcharge is based on a weekly fuel price \nfrom two days prior to the day in which it is assessed. Effective July 1, 2024, the tables used to determine fuel surcharges at FedEx \nFreight were updated. See the “Results of Operations and Outlook — Consolidated Results — Fuel” section of “Item 7. \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” for more information.\nFedEx Custom Critical \nFedEx Custom Critical provides a range of expedited, time-specific freight-shipping services throughout the U.S., Canada, and \nMexico.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” of this \nAnnual Report.\n- 14 -\nTrademarks\nFederal Express owns numerous trademarks and intellectual property rights relating to the “FedEx” trademark. Those trademarks, \nservice marks, and trade names are essential to our worldwide business, and include FedEx, FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx \nFreight, FedEx Services, FedEx Office, FedEx Logistics, FedEx Dataworks, FedEx Trade Networks Transport & Brokerage, FedEx \nSupply Chain, FedEx Custom Critical, and ShopRunner. Federal Express licenses the use of certain trademarks to support our \nbusiness, and takes active measures to enforce its intellectual property rights where appropriate. \nRegulation \nAir. Under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended (the “Federal Aviation Act”), both the U.S. Department of Transportation \n(“DOT”) and the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) exercise regulatory authority over Federal Express’s air operations. \nThe FAA’s regulatory authority relates primarily to operational aspects of air transportation, including aircraft standards and \nmaintenance, as well as personnel and ground facilities, which may from time to time affect the ability of Federal Express to operate \nits aircraft in the most efficient manner. Federal Express holds an air carrier certificate granted by the FAA pursuant to Part 119 of the \nfederal aviation regulations. This certificate is of unlimited duration and remains in effect so long as Federal Express maintains its \nstandards of safety and meets the operational requirements of the regulations. \nThe DOT’s authority relates primarily to economic aspects of air transportation. The DOT’s jurisdiction extends to aviation route \nauthority and to other regulatory matters, including the transfer of route authority between carriers. Federal Express holds various \ncertificates issued by the DOT authorizing the company to engage in U.S. and international air transportation of property and mail on \na worldwide basis. These certificates remain in effect as we maintain our economic fitness to perform all-cargo services following the \none FedEx consolidation.\nUnder the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001, as amended, the Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”), an \nagency within the Department of Homeland Security, has responsibility for aviation security. The TSA requires Federal Express to \ncomply with a Full All-Cargo Aircraft Operator Standard Security Plan, which contains evolving and strict security requirements. \nThese requirements are not static, but change periodically as the result of regulatory and legislative requirements, imposing additional \nsecurity costs and creating a level of uncertainty for our operations. It is reasonably possible that these rules or other future security \nrequirements could impose material costs on us. \nFederal Express participates in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (“CRAF”) program. Under this program, the U.S. Department of Defense \nmay requisition for military use certain of Federal Express’s wide-bodied aircraft in the event of a declared need, including a national \nemergency. Federal Express is compensated for the operation of any aircraft requisitioned under the CRAF program at standard \ncontract rates established each year in the normal course of awarding contracts. Through its participation in the CRAF program, \nFederal Express is entitled to bid on peacetime military cargo charter business. Federal Express, together with a consortium of other \ncarriers, currently contracts with the U.S. government for such charter flights. \nSee “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report for discussion of regulations related to pilots, including the proposed pilot flight \nand duty time regulations, that could affect our business.\nGround. The ground transportation performed by employees of Federal Express is integral to its air transportation services. The \nenactment of the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 abrogated the authority of states to regulate the rates, \nroutes, or services of intermodal all-cargo air carriers and most motor carriers. States may now only exercise jurisdiction over safety \nand insurance. Federal Express is registered in those states that require registration. \nThe interstate operations of Federal Express that utilize contracted service providers to conduct certain linehaul operations, as well as \nthe interstate operations of FedEx Freight and FedEx Custom Critical, are currently regulated by the DOT and the Federal Motor \nCarrier Safety Administration, which retain limited oversight authority over motor carriers. Federal legislation preempts regulation by \nthe states of rates, routes, and services in interstate freight transportation. \nLike other interstate motor carriers, our operations are subject to certain DOT safety requirements governing interstate operations. In \naddition, vehicle weight and dimensions remain subject to both federal and state regulations.\nInternational. Federal Express’s international authority permits it to carry cargo and mail from points in its U.S. route system to \nnumerous points throughout the world. The DOT regulates international routes and practices and is authorized to investigate and take \naction against discriminatory treatment of U.S. air carriers abroad. The right of a U.S. carrier to serve foreign points is subject to the \n- 15 -\nDOT’s approval and generally requires a bilateral agreement between the U.S. and the foreign government. In addition, the carrier \nmust then be granted the permission of such foreign government to provide specific flights and services. The regulatory environment \nfor global aviation rights may from time to time impair the ability of Federal Express to operate its air network in the most efficient \nmanner, and efficient operations often utilize open skies provisions of aviation agreements. Additionally, global air cargo carriers, \nsuch as Federal Express, are subject to current and potential additional aviation security regulation by U.S. and foreign governments. \nOur operations outside of the U.S., such as Federal Express’s international domestic operations, are also subject to current and \npotential regulations, including certain postal regulations and licensing requirements, that restrict, make difficult, and sometimes \nprohibit, the ability of foreign-owned companies such as Federal Express to compete effectively in parts of the international domestic \ntransportation and logistics market. \nEnvironmental. \nNoise: Pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act, the FAA, with the assistance of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), is \nauthorized to establish standards governing aircraft noise. Federal Express’s aircraft fleet is in compliance with current FAA noise \nstandards. Although the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 established a National Noise Policy that enables certain airport \noperators to implement noise abatement programs, it created an opportunity for Federal Express to plan for noise reduction and better \nrespond to local noise constraints. Additionally, certain U.S. airport operators have implemented local noise regulations, and certain \nforeign jurisdictions impose noise-based limitations on airline operations. Neither the National Noise Policy nor any domestic or \nforeign local noise regulations have a material effect in any of Federal Express’s significant markets. \nGreenhouse Gas Emissions: Concern over climate change, including the effect of global warming, has led to significant U.S. and \ninternational legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions, including our aircraft and vehicle engine \nemissions. Increasingly, state and local governments are also considering GHG regulatory requirements. Compliance with such \nregulation and the associated potential cost is complicated by the fact that various countries and regions are following different \napproaches to the regulation of climate change. In 2016, the International Civil Aviation Organization (“ICAO”) formally adopted a \nglobal, market-based emissions offset program known as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation \n(“CORSIA”). This program established a goal for the aviation industry to achieve carbon neutral growth in international aviation \nbeginning in calendar 2021. Any growth above a global industry emissions baseline would need to be addressed using either eligible \ncarbon offset credits or qualifying sustainable aviation fuel purchases. The baseline was originally set as an average of calendar 2019 \nand calendar 2020 emissions. In 2023, due to the effects of COVID-19 on the airline industry, the ICAO adopted a new baseline of \n85% of calendar 2019 emissions. The U.S. has not fully implemented CORSIA to date. In the interim, we continue to voluntarily \nreport our emissions data to the FAA.\nOther ICAO member states are moving forward with implementing CORSIA and have taken additional action to reduce aircraft GHG \nemissions. For example, both the EU and the United Kingdom have implemented regulations to include aviation in the Emissions \nTrading Scheme (“ETS”). For the EU, under these regulations any airline with flights originating or landing in the European \nEconomic Area (“EEA”) is subject to the ETS. Beginning in calendar 2012, airlines including Federal Express were required to \npurchase emissions allowances or, alternatively, purchase qualifying sustainable aviation fuel if they exceeded the number of free \nallowances allocated under the ETS. While the current scope of ETS has been limited to apply only to flights within the EEA through \ncalendar 2026, the EU adopted legislation in 2023 requiring that a study be conducted in July 2026 reassessing whether the European \nCommission should propose to expand the scope of ETS to include international flights from the EEA based on CORSIA \nimplementation and performance.\nWe expect compliance with CORSIA and the ETS to increase FedEx operating expenses. The amount of such increase will ultimately \ndepend on a number of factors, including the number of our flights subject to CORSIA and the ETS, the fuel efficiency of our fleet, \nthe average growth of the aviation sector, our ability to utilize sustainable aviation fuels in the future and the price of such fuels, the \navailability of free allowances (which will be eliminated entirely by the end of calendar 2026), and the price of eligible emission units, \noffsets, or allowances required to be purchased by FedEx. \nAdditionally, in 2017, ICAO adopted new carbon dioxide emissions standards that would apply not only to new aircraft types as of \ncalendar 2020, but also to new deliveries of currently in-production aircraft types from calendar 2023. ICAO established a production \ncutoff date of January 1, 2028 for aircraft that do not comply with these standards. The standards are considered to be especially \nstringent for larger aircraft weighing over 60 tons. In 2021, the EPA adopted its own aircraft and aircraft engine GHG emissions \nstandards, which are aligned with the 2017 ICAO emissions standards, and the FAA finalized its own conforming rulemaking to \nimplement the standards through its aircraft certification process which went into effect on April 16, 2024. In the past, the U.S. \nCongress has also considered bills that would regulate GHG emissions, and some form of federal climate change legislation is \npossible in the future. In 2021 the U.S. reentered the Paris climate accord, an agreement among 197 countries to reduce GHG \nemissions. The effect of the reentry on future U.S. policy regarding GHG emissions and on other GHG regulation is uncertain. \n- 16 -\nAdditionally, the extent to which other countries implement that agreement could have an adverse direct or indirect effect on our \nbusiness. \nSee “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Environmental, Climate, and Weather Risks — We may be affected by global climate change or by \nlegal, regulatory, or market responses to such change” for information on disclosure requirements regarding GHG emissions and other \nenvironmental matters.\nSustainable Aviation Fuels: On October 18, 2023, the EU adopted its Refuel EU regulation requiring fuel producers at certain EU \nairports to supply a minimum percentage of blended sustainable aviation fuel to aircraft operators beginning January 1, 2025. The \nmandate requires that, beginning in calendar 2025, two percent of the jet fuel supplied in certain EU airports must qualify as \nsustainable aviation fuel, and the percentage increases incrementally to 70% in calendar 2050. Fuel suppliers have incorporated a \nsustainable aviation fee into future uptake agreements for their compliance costs related to the Refuel EU regulation. A similar \nmandate is expected to go into effect in the United Kingdom on January 1, 2025.\nHazardous Substances: Although a petition for review was filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in June 2024, the \nEPA rule designating certain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”) as “hazardous substances” under the Comprehensive \nEnvironmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) became effective July 8, 2024. Numerous U.S. states have \nadopted additional regulations governing these substances. PFAS are used in a wide variety of consumer and industrial products, \nincluding the firefighting foams approved for use by the FAA to extinguish fuel-based fires at airports and refineries. The EPA rule \ncould subject airlines and refineries to potential liability for cleanup of historical PFAS contamination. We could incur remediation \ncosts for currently and formerly operated facilities. While the impact of this rulemaking on our business and results of operations \ncannot currently be predicted, we remain committed to transitioning to PFAS-free materials for fire suppression in accordance with \nthe framework outlined by the FAA in May 2023.\nVehicle Emissions Regulations: In October 2023, the California Air Resources Board’s (“CARB”) Advanced Clean Fleets (“ACF”) \nrule requiring subject companies to adopt an increasing percentage of medium and heavy duty zero emission trucks (“ZEVs”) became \neffective. While the rule is currently subject to litigation, FedEx selected the ZEV milestones option to meet its compliance obligation \nunder the rule. This option requires that we continuously meet or exceed certain scheduled ZEV fleet milestone percentage \nrequirements, as outlined in the regulation. The ZEV milestones option ultimately requires fleets to transition to 100% ZEVs by a \ntarget date according to vehicle type. While the ACF rule may permit companies to seek exemptions or relief in certain instances, \nthere are no assurances that relief from the regulation will be obtained. At this point, there are virtually no ZEVs widely available that \nare suitable replacements for vehicles currently used, and there does not appear to be sufficient infrastructure in place to support an \nelectric vehicle fleet operation throughout our current terminal network. Further, additional states have adopted rules similar to \nCARB’s ACF rule with more expected to follow. To address these regulatory requirements, FedEx has made investments in capital \nequipment, vehicles, and infrastructure.\nWe are also subject to other U.S. and international environmental laws and regulations relating to, among other things, the shipment of \ndangerous goods, the management of underground storage tanks, the discharge of effluents from our properties and equipment, and \ncontingency planning for spills of petroleum products. Additionally, certain contractual and lease agreements governing regulated \nsubstances could trigger investigation and remediation obligations if sites become affected. Federal Express has an environmental \nmanagement system based on International Standardization 14001 designed to maintain compliance with these regulations and \nminimize our operational environmental footprint and certified all U.S. airport locations in 2022. \nExport Controls. In recent years, the U.S. government has increased the number of companies and persons subject to U.S. export \ncontrol regulations. Such regulations can restrict the types of items that FedEx customers are permitted to ship to certain entities, and \nin some instances may prohibit FedEx from serving certain entities altogether. Violations of these regulations can result in significant \nmonetary and other penalties. For example, the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 (the “ECRA”) and its implementing regulations, \nthe Export Administration Regulations (the “EARs”), hold carriers such as FedEx strictly liable for shipments that may violate the \nEARs without requiring evidence that the carriers had knowledge of any violations. Violations of the ECRA can result in criminal \npenalties of up to $1 million and civil penalties up to $365,000 (or twice the value of the transaction) per individual violation. FedEx \ncontinues to invest in improvements and updates to its export control compliance programs. However, the heightened focus on export \ncontrols by the U.S. government increases FedEx’s exposure to potential regulatory penalties and could result in higher compliance \ncosts. \nCustoms Clearance, Customs Brokerage, and Freight Forwarding. Our customs clearance activities, including customs brokerage, \nare subject to regulation by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and other partner government agencies (for example, the Food and \nDrug Administration) that regulate the importation and exportation of specific products. Our freight forwarding activities are regulated \nby the Transportation Security Administration within the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission \n(ocean freight forwarding), and the Department of Transportation (air freight forwarding). Our offshore operations are subject to \nsimilar regulation by the regulatory authorities of foreign jurisdictions. \n- 17 -\nLabor. All U.S. employees at Federal Express are covered by the Railway Labor Act of 1926, as amended (the “RLA”), while labor \nrelations within the U.S. at our other companies are governed by the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, as amended (the \n“NLRA”). Under the RLA, groups that wish to unionize must do so across nationwide classes of employees. The RLA also requires \nmandatory government-led mediation of contract disputes supervised by the National Mediation Board (“NMB”) before a union can \nstrike or an employer can replace employees or impose contract terms. This part of the RLA helps minimize the risk of strikes that \nwould shut down large portions of the economy. Under the NLRA, employees can unionize in small localized groups, and \ngovernment-led mediation is not a required step in the negotiation process. \nThe RLA was originally passed to govern railroad and express carrier labor negotiations. As transportation systems evolved, the law \nexpanded to cover airlines, which are now the dominant national transportation systems. As an air express carrier with an integrated \nair/ground network, Federal Express and its employees have been covered by the RLA since the founding of the company. The \npurpose of the RLA is to offer employees a process by which to unionize (if they choose) and engage in collective bargaining while \nalso protecting global commerce from damaging work stoppages and delays. Specifically, the RLA ensures that an entire \ntransportation system, such as at Federal Express, cannot be shut down by the actions of a local segment of the network. \nThe U.S. Congress has, in the past, considered adopting changes in labor laws that would make it easier for unions to organize units of \nour employees. For example, there is always a possibility that Congress could remove most Federal Express employees from the \njurisdiction of the RLA, thereby exposing the Federal Express network to sporadic labor disputes and the risk that small groups of \nemployees could disrupt the entire air/ground express network. This jurisdiction could be challenged in connection with our one \nFedEx consolidation and Network 2.0. In addition, the NMB and the National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”) have and may \ncontinue to take actions that could make it easier for our employees, and employees of service providers contracting with Federal \nExpress to conduct certain linehaul and pickup-and-delivery operations, to organize under the RLA or NLRA. For a description of \nthese and other potential labor law changes, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report.\nData Protection. There has recently been heightened regulatory and enforcement focus relating to the collection, use, retention, \ntransfer, and processing of personal data in the U.S. (at both the state and federal level) and internationally.

REUTERS/Brian Snyder/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tab Companies BEIJING, May 13 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden is set to announce new China tariffs as soon as Tuesday, targeting sectors including electric vehicles, medical supplies and solar equipment, according to people familiar with the matter. The expected move by the Biden administration comes ahead of the November presidential election. Biden, a Democrat seeking re-election, has taken a tough-on-China approach that would maintain existing tariffs on many Chinese goods set by former President Donald Trump, his expected Republican challenger. Sign up here. The impact on Chinese industries, however, is expected to be limited. DOES CHINA EXPORT EVS TO THE UNITED STATES? Very few. In the first quarter, Geely (GEELY.UL) was the only Chinese automaker to export to the United States with 2,217 cars, according to data from the China Passenger Car Association. Geely, which has sold some EVs in the U.S. market under its Polestar brand, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. China\'s Geely and Sweden\'s Volvo Cars (VOLCARb.ST), opens new tab founded EV maker Polestar Automotive, which makes most of its cars in China. Volvo is majority-owned by Geely. Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath told Reuters last month the company is accelerating efforts to produce more vehicles outside China. Polestar aims for a sales breakdown of 40% in Europe, 30% in the United States and 30% in the Asia-Pacific region, he said. Ingenlath told Reuters last year that Polestar will start production in South Carolina for U.S. and European markets from 2024. ARE NEW TARIFFS A THREAT TO CHINA\'S SOLAR INDUSTRY? The market is small for China and exports to the United States have been subject to tariffs for more than a decade. Further duties were also recently imposed on several Chinese solar panel makers who finished their panels in Southeast Asia. Over 80% of solar panel manufacturing now takes place in China, and the cost of making a panel in China is 60% cheaper than in the U.S., according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. Last year, China exported $3.35 million solar cells to the U.S., less than 0.1% of China\'s total exports. Outbound shipments of completed solar panels to the U.S. stood at $13.15 million in 2023, only 0.03% of China\'s solar panel exports. Industry observers said the equipment to produce solar panels involves a complicated supply chain. How the new U.S. tariffs affect sales of that equipment will depend on the details of the U.S. trade levy, they said. WHAT ABOUT MEDICAL SUPPLIES? Chinese-made medical supplies such as syringes and personal protective equipment also face additional U.S. tariffs, sources familiar with the decision said. According to WTO data, China exported $30.9 billion medical goods to the United States in 2022, accounting for about one fifth of China\'s overall exports of medical goods. The expected tariffs are part of the Biden administration\'s broader strategy to protect the U.S. against supply shortages seen during the pandemic that left hospitals scrambling to find critical equipment, the sources said. In December, the United States Trade Representative announced a further extension of China-related "Section 301" tariff exclusions until May 31. The American Medical Manufacturers Association has called for these exclusions to be revoked, arguing they are no longer needed to deal with a COVID-19 emergency. The association says American manufacturers need the chance to compete with imports on a more level playing field. MORE TARIFFS ON METAL PRODUCTS? Biden in April also called for tripling U.S. tariffs on Chinese metal products. That would apply to more than $1 billion worth of steel and aluminium products, a U.S. official said.

Founded in 1847 as a mine operator, we are also the largest manufacturer of iron ore pellets in North America. We are vertically integrated from mined raw materials, direct reduced iron, and ferrous scrap to primary steelmaking and downstream finishing, stamping, tooling and tubing. We are the largest supplier of steel to the automotive industry in North America and serve a diverse range of other markets due to our comprehensive offering of flat-rolled steel products. Headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, we employ approximately 28,000 people across our operations in the United States and Canada. COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS As the leading flat-rolled steel producer in North America, we benefit from having the size and scale necessary in a competitive, capital intensive business. Our sizeable operating footprint provides us with the operational leverage and flexibility to achieve competitive margins throughout the business cycle. We also have a unique vertically integrated profile from mined raw materials, direct reduced iron, and ferrous scrap to primary steelmaking and downstream finishing, stamping, tooling and tubing. This positioning gives us more predictable costs throughout our supply chain and more control over both our manufacturing inputs and our end-product destination. Our primary competitive strength lies within our automotive steel business. We are a leading supplier of automotive-grade steel in the U.S. Compared to other steel end markets, automotive steel is generally higher quality, more operationally and technologically intensive to produce, and requires significantly more devotion to customer service than other steel end markets. This dedication to service and the infrastructure in place to meet our automotive customers’ demanding needs took decades to develop. We have continued to invest capital and resources to meet the requirements needed to serve the automotive industry and intend to maintain our position as an industry leader going forward. Due to its demanding nature, the automotive steel business typically generates higher through-the-cycle margins, making it a desirable end market. Demand for automotive-grade steel is expected to remain strong in the coming years as a result of low unemployment, pent-up automotive demand arising out of supply chain issues and the replacement of older vehicles. Our footprint provides us with a competitive advantage in supplying automotive and other highly demanding end markets, as we are able to produce a wide range of high-quality products. Our integrated facilities utilize domestic internally sourced iron ore as the primary feedstock, which allows us to produce a high-quality product with low residual content. We also possess the breadth and depth related to customer service, technical support, and research and development, which are necessary to supply the demanding needs of the automotive industry. Since the acquisition of our steelmaking assets, we have dedicated significant resources to maintain and upgrade our facilities and equipment. The quality of our assets gives us a unique advantage in product offerings and operational efficiencies. After elevated spend in 2022 to perform overdue maintenance work at the facilities acquired as part of the 2020 acquisitions, we resumed normalized levels of maintenance capital and operating expense in 2023. The necessary resources that we have invested in our footprint are expected to keep our assets at an automotive-grade level of quality and reliability for years to come. Our industry leading portfolio of fixed price contracts provides us a competitive advantage, as the steel industry is often viewed as volatile and subject to the market price of steel. Our fixed price contracts mitigate pricing volatility and support us in achieving healthy margins through the cycle. Our ability to source our primary feedstock domestically and internally is a competitive strength. This model reduces our exposure to volatile pricing and unreliable global sourcing. The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, along with other global tensions, has displayed the importance of our U.S.-centric footprint, as our competitors who primarily operate EAF facilities rely on imported pig iron to produce flat-rolled steel, the supply of which has been disrupted. The best example is our legacy business of producing iron ore pellets. By controlling our iron ore pellet supply, our primary steelmaking raw material feedstock can be secured at a stable and predictable cost and not be subject to as many factors outside of our control. We believe we offer the most comprehensive flat-rolled steel product selection in the industry, along with several complementary products and services. A sampling of our offering includes AHSS, hot-dipped galvanized, aluminized, galvalume, electrogalvanized, galvanneal, HRC, cold-rolled coil, plate, tinplate, GOES, NOES, stainless steels, tool and die, stamped components, rail, slab and cast ingot. Across the quality spectrum and the supply chain, our customers can frequently find the solutions they need from our product selection. We are currently a leading producer of electrical steels referred to as GOES and NOES in the U.S. In November 2021, the Infrastructure and Jobs Act was passed in the U.S., which provides funding to be used for the modernization of the electrical grid and the infrastructure needed to allow for increased EV adoption, both of which require electrical steels. Our electrical steel business is expected to continue achieving strong profitability in the coming years. During the second half of 2023, we commissioned our NOES expansion at our Zanesville facility, which increased our annual capacity by approximately 70,000 net tons. We are the first and the only producer of HBI in the Great Lakes region. Construction of our Toledo direct reduction plant was completed in the fourth quarter of 2020 and reached full run-rate nameplate annual capacity of 1.9 million metric tons during the middle of 2021. From this modern plant, we produce a high-quality, low-cost and low-carbon intensive HBI product that can be used in our blast furnaces as a productivity enhancer, or in our BOFs and EAFs as a premium scrap alternative. We use HBI to stretch our hot metal production, lowering carbon intensity and reliance on coke. With increasing tightness in the scrap and metallics markets combined with our own internal needs, we expect our Toledo direct reduction plant to support healthy margins for us going forward. STRATEGY MAXIMIZE OUR COMMERCIAL STRENGTHS We offer a full suite of flat steel products encompassing effectively all of our customers\' needs. We are a leading supplier to the automotive sector, where our portfolio of high-end products delivers a broad range of differentiated solutions for this highly sought after customer base. As a result of our exposure to these high-end markets, we have the highest fixed price contractual volumes in our industry. Approximately 40-45% of our volumes are sold under these contracts. These contracts reduce volatility and allow for more predictable through-the-cycle margins. In addition to our fixed price contracts, we also sell significant volumes under index-linked contracts, which reduces our reliance on spot sales and allows us to improve our efficiency with increased volumes. Our unique capabilities, driven by our portfolio of assets and technical expertise, give us an advantage in our flat-rolled product offering. We offer products that have superior formability, surface quality, strength and corrosion resistance for the automotive industry. In addition, our state-of-the-art Research and Innovation Center in Middletown, Ohio gives us the ability to collaborate with our customers and create new products and develop new and efficient steel manufacturing processes. During 2022, we introduced our MOTOR-MAX™ product line of NOES for high frequency motors and generators. During 2023, we introduced our C-STAR™ protection design, which was developed for the purpose of providing EV battery protection for improved safety purposes, but can be used in any type of light vehicle. These unique product offerings and customer service capabilities enable us to remain a leading steel supplier to the automotive industry. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUR U.S.-CENTRIC, INTERNALLY SOURCED SUPPLY CHAIN The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has reinforced the unique advantage of our vertically integrated business model. Two-thirds of U.S. imports of pig iron, a critical raw material for flat-rolled EAFs, had historically been sourced from Russia and Ukraine. This supply remains largely disrupted, driving volatility in input costs and reducing availability for our competitors’ ferrous inputs. We, on the other hand, produce our pig iron and liquid steel entirely in the U.S., supported by internally sourced iron ore and HBI and supplemented with internally sourced scrap. In addition, our internally produced pig iron is more environmentally friendly than imported pig iron, which is often made from sintered iron ore fines and with higher coke rates, for example. While competitors are forced to rely on suppliers who are subject to unpredictable disruptions in their ability to supply materials, we are able to take advantage of our vertically integrated footprint. We began construction of our Toledo direct reduction plant in 2017, in part because of the uncertainty of the industry sourcing metallics from Russia and Ukraine. Russia had previously invaded the Crimea peninsula in 2014, and we saw a need for more on-shore metallics capacity in the U.S. HBI, which is a lower-carbon alternative to imported pig iron, continues to be a critical component of our decarbonization strategy. OPTIMIZE OUR FULLY-INTEGRATED STEELMAKING FOOTPRINT We are a fully-integrated steel enterprise with the size and scale to achieve margins above industry averages for flat-rolled steel. Our focus remains on realizing our inherent cost advantage in flat-rolled steel while also lowering carbon emissions. The combination of our ferrous raw materials, including iron ore, scrap and HBI, allows us to do so relative to peers who must rely on more unpredictable and unreliable raw material sourcing strategies. We have ample access to scrap along with internally sourced iron ore pellets and HBI. Our ability to optimize use of these raw materials in our blast furnaces and BOFs ultimately boosts liquid steel output, reduces coke needs and lowers carbon emissions from our operations. As a result of successful operational improvements, we announced the indefinite idle of the Indiana Harbor #4 blast furnace in the first quarter of 2022. The indefinite idle reduced our operational blast furnaces from eight to seven. Our strategic use of HBI in our blast furnaces and maximizing scrap usage in our BOFs has allowed us to achieve the same steel production with one less blast furnace in our footprint. During the second quarter of 2023, it was announced that we entered into long-term state mineral leases for more than 2,600 acres of iron ore at the Nashwauk mine site in Itasca County, Minnesota. The award of these leases is expected to resolve years of uncertainty regarding Hibbing Taconite’s mine life. This ore body is intended to serve as an extension of Hibbing Taconite, as the state’s mineral leases, combined with our own private mineral holdings at Nashwauk, are expected to provide more than two decades of additional ore reserves. The necessary resources that we have invested in our footprint are expected to keep our assets at an automotive-grade level of quality and reliability for years to come, positioning us to benefit from operating efficiencies and improved capabilities in the coming years. ADVANCE OUR PARTICIPATION IN THE GREEN ECONOMY We are seeking to expand our customer base with the desirable EV market. At this time, we believe the North American automotive industry is at a structural inflection point, with the adoption of electrical motors in passenger vehicles. As this market grows, it will require more advanced steel applications to meet the needs of EV producers and consumers. These features include the already existing sophisticated steel supply for internal combustion engine vehicle parts, along with the added need for steel-based battery enclosures and reinforcement in EVs. With our unique technical capabilities and leadership in the automotive industry, we believe we are positioned better than any other North American steelmaker to supply the steel and parts necessary to fill these needs. We also have the right products to meet the growing demand for renewable energy as well as for the modernization of the U.S. electrical grid. We offer plate products that can be used in windmills, which we estimate contain 130 tons of steel per megawatt of electricity. In addition, panels for solar power are heavy consumers of galvanized steel, where we are a leading producer. We estimate solar panels consume 40 tons of steel per megawatt of electricity. We are currently a leading producer of electrical steel in the U.S., which can facilitate the modernization of the U.S. electrical grid. Along with charging networks, electrical steels are also needed in the motors of EVs. ENHANCE OUR ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY Our commitment to operating our business in a more environmentally responsible manner remains constant. One of the most important issues impacting our industry, our stakeholders and our planet is climate change. In early 2021, we announced our commitment to reduce GHG emissions 25% from 2017 levels by 2030. This goal represents combined Scope 1 (direct emissions) and Scope 2 (indirect emissions from purchased electricity or other forms of energy) GHG emission reductions across all of our operations. Our 2022 absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions were below our reduction goal well ahead of our 2030 target year. Since 2017, we have reduced our absolute emissions by 32% from 44 million metric tons to 30 million metric tons of CO 2 e in 2022. In May 2023, we completed a successful blast furnace hydrogen injection trial at Middletown Works. During the trial, hydrogen gas was injected in all 20 tuyeres at the Middletown #3 blast furnace, facilitating the production of clean pig iron. In this trial, hydrogen served as a partial substitute for the fossil fuels necessary for iron reduction, ultimately replacing the release of CO 2 with the release of H 2 O (water vapor) with no impact to product quality or operating efficiency. In October 2023, the DOE announced the intention to award funding under the Infrastructure and Jobs Act for seven regional hydrogen hubs, including the Midwest Alliance for Clean Hydrogen. This hub covering Illinois, Indiana and Michigan was selected for $1 billion in funding and is near our two largest steel plants, Indiana Harbor and Burns Harbor. We recently commissioned a pipeline and successfully completed a hydrogen injection trial at our Indiana Harbor blast furnace #7. This follows an initial similar trial of hydrogen at our blast furnace in Middletown earlier in 2023. The use of hydrogen within our blast furnace is expected to partially reduce coke rate and displace the release of CO 2 with H 2 O, reducing our overall emissions. Our future GHG emissions reductions are expected to be driven by the use of direct reduced iron in blast furnaces, the stretching of hot metal with additional scrap, driving more productivity out of fewer blast furnaces, implementing hydrogen use where possible, adopting carbon capture and utilization, procuring more clean energy and operating with higher energy efficiency. IMPROVE FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY Given the cyclicality of our business, it is important to us to be in the financial position to easily withstand economic cycles and be opportunistic when attractive strategic opportunities arise. Since the acquisition of our steelmaking assets in 2020, we have demonstrated our ability to generate healthy free cash flow and use it to reduce substantial amounts of debt, return capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program, and make investments to both improve and grow our business. During 2023, we reduced the principal amount of outstanding long-term debt by $1.1 billion while returning $152 million in capital to shareholders via share repurchases. We have also historically shown our ability to take advantage of volatility in the debt markets and repurchase notes at a discount. We expect to have ample opportunities to reduce our debt and return capital to shareholders with our own free cash flow generation in the coming years. It is also important for us to maintain sufficient liquidity. Our liquidity as of December 31, 2023 of $4.5 billion is the highest in our Company’s history. BUSINESS OPERATIONS We have a vertically integrated portfolio, which begins at the mining stage and goes all the way through the manufacturing of steel products, including stamping, tooling and tubing. We have the unique advantage as a steel producer of being fully or partially self-sufficient with our production of raw materials for steel manufacturing, which includes iron ore pellets, HBI, scrap and coking coal. We are organized into four operating segments based on the differentiated products – Steelmaking, Tubular, Tooling and Stamping and European Operations. We primarily operate through one reportable segment – the Steelmaking segment. Our primary steel producing and finishing facilities are located across Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. We operate seven blast furnaces and five EAFs with the configured capability of producing approximately 20.5\xa0million tons of raw steel annually. Raw steel is generally cast into slabs and finished based on customer specifications. Finishing is completed on site at our integrated operations or at one of our standalone finishing facilities. Ferrous raw materials for the production of steel are internally sourced from our iron ore mines in Michigan and Minnesota, our direct reduction plant in Ohio and our scrap facilities in Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee, Florida and Ontario. We also operate a coal mining complex in West Virginia and produce coke from our facilities in Indiana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. Our Other Businesses primarily includes the Tubular Components and Tooling and Stamping operating segments that provide customer solutions with carbon and stainless steel tubing products, advanced-engineered solutions, tool design and build, hot- and cold-stamped steel components and complex assemblies. Refer to Part I - Item 2. Properties for additional information. PRODUCTS AND MARKETS 2023 Product Mix (By Revenue) Primary Products ◦ HOT-ROLLED ◦ STAINLESS AND ELECTRICAL ◦ OTHER ◦ COLD-ROLLED ◦ Scrap ◦ COATED ◦ GOES ◦ Iron Ore ◦ Aluminized ◦ NOES ◦ HBI ◦ Electrogalvanized ◦ Auto Chrome ◦ Coal ◦ Galvalume ◦ PLATE ◦ Coke ◦ Galvanneal ◦ SLAB AND OTHER STEEL PRODUCTS ◦ NON-STEELMAKING ◦ Hot-dipped Galvanized ◦ Stamped Components ◦ Tinplate ◦ Slab ◦ Tool and Die ◦ Rail ◦ Tubing ◦ Blooms ◦ Cast Ingots As a fully integrated steel enterprise, we have a comprehensive portfolio of steel solutions. We primarily sell our products to customers in four broad market categories. The following table presents the percentage of our revenues to each of these markets during the year: Market Primary Products Sold to End Market 2023 2022 Direct automotive Cold-rolled, galvanized, aluminized, NOES and stainless 36 \xa0 % 31\xa0 % Infrastructure and manufacturing Hot-rolled, cold-rolled, galvanized, plate, GOES, stainless, tinplate and rail 26 \xa0 % 26\xa0 % Distributors and converters All grades of steel 25 \xa0 % 28\xa0 % Steel producers Slab, scrap, iron ore, HBI, coal and coke 13 \xa0 % 15\xa0 % The change in percentages of revenues to each market in 2023, compared to 2022, was driven primarily by the increase in volumes and in selling prices for our fixed price contracts to the direct automotive market, lower pricing on index-linked sales, and lower pricing on spot sales. Additionally, our sales to the direct automotive market increased as prior supply chain issues eased and light vehicle production in North America reached the highest level since 2019. We sell our products principally to customers in North America. Approximately 40-45% of our flat-rolled steel shipments are sold under fixed base price contracts. These contracts are typically one year in duration and expire at various times throughout the year. Some of these contracts have a surcharge mechanism that passes through certain changes in input costs. A certain portion of our flat-rolled steel shipments are sold based on the spot market at prevailing market prices or under contracts that involve variable pricing that is tied to an independently published steel index. AUTOMOTIVE MARKET We specialize in manufacturing difficult-to-produce and high-quality steel products with demanding delivery performance and first-class customer technical support. Through our collaborative relationships with automotive producers, we develop breakthrough steel solutions that help our customers meet their product requirements. The quality of our steel is appealing to end users because of its strength, surface quality and formability. EAF producers’ equipment is designed to utilize scrap as their main feedstock, which often contains high residual or impure content, limiting their product capabilities. The exacting requirements for servicing the automotive market generally allows for higher selling prices for products sold to that market than for the commodity types of steel sold to other markets. The largest end user for our steel products is the automotive industry in North America, which makes light vehicle production a key driver of demand. During 2023, North American light vehicle production was 15.6 million units, up from 14.3 million units in 2022. North American light vehicle production in 2024 is estimated to exceed 2023 units, indicating continued strength from the automotive industry. The long-term outlook for the automotive industry remains positive as pent-up demand remains strong, inventory levels are below historical averages and the average age of vehicles on the road in the U.S. reached an all-time high during 2023, surpassing the previous record set in 2022. Furthermore, during 2023, consumer demand for sport utility vehicles, trucks and crossovers continued to increase while demand for smaller sedans and compact cars declined. We benefit from intentionally targeting larger vehicle platforms to take advantage of consumer preferences, and we have focused on and have been successful in supplying sizeable portions of numerous large vehicle platforms. As a result, a significant portion of the automotive steel that we sell is used to produce these popular larger vehicles. In addition to benefiting from our exposure to consumers’ strong demand for larger vehicles, these vehicles also typically contain a higher volume of steel than smaller sedans and compact cars, providing us the opportunity to sell a higher volume of our steel products. Automotive manufacturers continue to explore opportunities to develop vehicles that are lighter in weight. We collaborate with our automotive customers and their suppliers to develop innovative solutions using our developments in light weighting, efficiency, and material strength and formability across our extensive product portfolio, in combination with our automotive stamping and tube-making capabilities. During 2023, we introduced an all steel battery box design utilizing various grades of AHSS for improved use for lower GHG emissions, to maintain light-weighting targets, and to gain cost benefits when compared to using alternative materials. We believe we offer steel products that are stronger, less expensive, have competitive weight savings, are easier to repair and are more environmentally friendly than alternative materials. Automotive manufacturers have also been increasing their development of EVs in order to meet the growing customer adoption of EVs. Many motors used in EVs being sold in the U.S. today are imported from foreign suppliers, but more local sourcing and manufacturing of motors is expected to occur in the future. As a leading producer in North America of high-efficiency NOES, which is a critical component of EV motors, we are positioned to potentially benefit from the growth of EVs going forward. During 2023, we introduced our C-STAR™ protection design, which was developed for the purpose of providing EV battery protection for improved safety purposes, but can be used in any type of light vehicle. In 2022, we introduced our MOTOR-MAX™ product line of NOES for high frequency motors and generators. We believe our strong foundation in electrical steels and long-standing relationships with automotive manufacturers and their suppliers will provide us with an advantage in this market as it continues to grow and mature. Likewise, the growing customer adoption of EVs may also increase demand for improvements in the electric grid to support higher demand for more extensive battery charging, which our GOES could support. The majority of our sales to the automotive market are under annual fixed price contracts. In 2024, we expect contract prices to be roughly similar when compared to the prior year. INFRASTRUCTURE AND MANUFACTURING MARKET We sell a variety of our steel products, including hot-rolled, cold-rolled, galvanized, plate, stainless, electrical, tinplate and rail, to the infrastructure and manufacturing market. This market includes sales to manufacturers of HVAC, appliances, power transmission and distribution transformers, storage tanks, ships, railcars, wind towers, machinery parts, heavy equipment, military armor, food preservation and railway lines. Domestic construction activity and the replacement of aging infrastructure directly affect sales of steel to this market. Recent government legislation, including the Infrastructure and Jobs Act, the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, is expected to keep demand elevated for steel products related to renewable energy, as well as the modernization of the U.S. electrical grid. Our plate products can be used in windmills, which we estimate contain 130 metric tons of steel per megawatt of electrical generating capacity. Additionally, we estimate solar panels consume 40 metric tons of steel per megawatt of electrical generating capacity. We should also continue to benefit from a tax credit provided by the Inflation Reduction Act for consumers who buy new EVs, which should increase the demand for our electrical steel used in charging stations. Sales to this end market are made under a combination of annual fixed price contracts and index-linked pricing arrangements. Our selling prices under our annual fixed price contracts are expected to be roughly similar in 2024 when compared to the prior year. DISTRIBUTORS AND CONVERTERS MARKET Virtually all of the grades of steel we produce are sold to the steel distributors and converters market. This market generally represents downstream steel service centers, which source various types of steel from us and fabricate it according to their customers\' needs. Our steel is typically sold to this market on a spot basis or under contracts linked to steel pricing indices. Demand and pricing for this market can be highly dependent on a variety of factors, including global and domestic commodity steel production capacity, demand for manufactured goods, the price of scrap, the relative health of the global economy, the import and export levels of other steel producing nations, service center inventory management, the provisions of international trade agreements and fluctuations in international currencies. The price for domestic HRC, the most significant index in driving the revenues and profitability of our Steelmaking segment, averaged $906 per net ton for 2023, compared to $1,011 per net ton in 2022. The main decline in pricing occurred in the third quarter of 2023 as demand from service centers was adversely impacted due to the anticipation of, and ultimate occurrence of, the UAW strike at certain domestic automotive producers. The automotive strike concluded in the fourth quarter of 2023, resulting in increased demand from our automotive and service center customers. This increased demand led to a sharp rebound in HRC pricing, which ended the year at approximately $1,100 per net ton. STEEL PRODUCERS MARKET The steel producers market represents third-party sales to other steel producers, including those who operate blast furnaces and EAFs. It includes sales of raw materials and semi-finished and finished goods, including iron ore pellets, coal, coke, HBI, scrap, slab and other steel products. FPT is one of the largest processors of prime scrap in the country. Our scrap presence has developed further since acquiring FPT as we have leveraged our long-standing flat-rolled automotive and other customer relationships into recycling partnerships. Our steelmaking operations consume a large portion of the ferrous scrap processed by FPT. We also have third-party sales of ferrous and non-ferrous scrap. Third-party slab sales are also a large component of sales to this market, which are primarily made under a long-term supply agreement that was initiated in connection with the closing of the AM USA Transaction. Production from our iron ore mines is predominantly consumed by our steelmaking operations. During 2023 and 2022, we sold 4 million and 3 million long tons of iron ore products, respectively, to third parties from our share of production from our iron ore mines. The merchant portion of our iron ore pellet production is sold pursuant to long-term supply agreements and through spot contracts. The price of busheling scrap, a necessary input for flat-rolled steel production in EAFs in the U.S., averaged $488 per long ton during 2023, an 8% decrease from the prior year, but remained well above the historical ten-year average of approximately $390 per long ton. We expect the price of busheling scrap to remain elevated above historical averages in the coming years due to the continued decline of prime scrap generation and the growth of EAF capacity in the U.S., along with a push for expanded scrap use globally. APPLIED TECHNOLOGY, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT The utilization of our research and development capabilities has allowed us to introduce new steel products to the marketplace. Our research and development activities provide us the ability to offer a broad range of steel products, improve existing products and processes and develop new ones. As part of our underlying strategy to maintain and improve our product, service and technical capabilities, research and innovation spend totaled $30 million and $24 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. As the largest supplier of steel to the automotive industry in North America, it is important that we maintain our world-class research and development team to expand our capabilities and bring new steel products to the marketplace. Our ongoing efforts begin at our state-of-the-art Research and Innovation Center in Middletown, Ohio, where we collaborate with our automotive customers and their suppliers to develop products that meet their needs. We have a customer technical support team that is dedicated to understanding customers’ current and long-term requirements and translating them into product designs. The dedication and resources we allocate toward our research and development help us maintain our extensive product offering and provide our automotive customers with solutions to meet their steel needs. Our research and development capabilities will support us in efforts to remain the leading supplier to the automotive industry as automotive manufacturers continue to pursue EVs, lighter weight vehicles and other advancements in vehicle capabilities. A prime example of our ability to help our customers through research and development can be seen in the support and products we offer as automotive manufacturers have started increasing their development of EVs to meet the growing consumer adoption of EVs. During 2023, we introduced our C-STAR™ protection design, which was developed for the purpose of providing EV battery protection for improved safety purposes, but can be used in any type of light vehicle. We also introduced an all steel battery box design utilizing various grades of AHSS for improved use for lower GHG emissions, to maintain light-weighting targets, and to gain cost benefits when compared to using alternative materials. We are also a leading producer in North America of high-efficiency NOES, which is a critical component of EV motors. Our MOTOR-MAX™ NOES product line is used for high frequency motors and generators. We believe our strong foundation in electrical steels and long-standing relationships with automotive manufacturers and their suppliers will provide us with an advantage in this market as it continues to grow and mature. COMPETITION Our Steelmaking segment primarily competes with domestic and foreign producers of flat-rolled carbon, plate, tinplate, stainless, rail and electrical steel, carbon and stainless tubular products, aluminum, carbon fiber, concrete and other materials that may be used as a substitute for flat-rolled steels in manufactured products. Our Tooling and Stamping and Tubular Components businesses both compete against other niche downstream business in highly fragmented markets. The steel industry is often viewed as volatile and is subject to the market price of steel. Market pricing can be adversely impacted from foreign competition selling steel products into the U.S. at discounts and the oversupply of steel products within the domestic market from both domestic and foreign competition. To limit our exposure to volatility from market pricing, we have structured our business to have an industry leading portion of fixed price contracts. Our fixed price contracts provide us stability on a large portion of our business when market pricing is volatile. Price, quality, on-time delivery, customer service, technical expertise and product innovation are the primary competitive factors in the steel industry and vary in importance according to the product category and customer requirements. Steel producers that sell to the automotive market are required to meet strict and high-quality product specifications that demand strong technical capabilities, investment in capital and other resources to manage inventory, customer service, and research and development. As the largest supplier of steel to the automotive industry in North America, we continue to meet all the requirements needed to serve the automotive industry and maintain our position as an industry leader going forward. Significant capital investments in equipment, technology and other resources that would effectively replicate our processes, at a likely higher cost than ours, would be required for certain competitors to meet all the demands required of the automotive industry. The steel industry has faced competition from aluminum manufacturers (and, to a lesser extent, other materials) as automotive manufacturers attempt to develop vehicles that are lighter in weight. To address automotive manufacturers’ light weighting needs that the aluminum industry is targeting, we have developed AHSS grades that we believe provide weight savings similar to aluminum, while being stronger, less costly, easier to repair, more sustainable and more environmentally friendly. Aluminum penetration has been primarily limited to specific automotive applications, such as outer panels and closures, rather than entire body designs. In addition, our automotive customers who continue to use steel, as opposed to aluminum and other alternative materials, are able to avoid the significant capital expenditures required to re-tool their manufacturing processes to accommodate the use of non-steel materials. EAFs comprise over 70% of steel production and more than 40% of flat-rolled steel production in the U.S. The primary raw materials used by EAFs include scrap metal and ore based metallics, which have unpredictable and often volatile pricing. Additionally, the availability of these materials can be unreliable as most competition relies on imported ore based metallics. Due to recently completed and further announced flat-rolled EAF capacity additions in the U.S. and increasing focus on industry decarbonization, we expect the price of scrap to remain elevated over historical averages, providing our integrated footprint a competitive cost advantage. Our integrated facilities utilize domestic internally sourced iron ore as the primary feedstock, which allows us to produce high-quality products with low residual content. We also possess the breadth and depth related to customer service, technical support, and research and development necessary to supply the demanding needs of the automotive industry and other demanding end markets. The additional capacity from domestic EAF competition could displace imports as the U.S. is still the largest net importer of steel in the world, and domestically produced steel is generally more environmentally friendly than imported steel. Domestic steel producers can face significant competition from foreign producers. In certain instances, these foreign producers are often able to sell products in the U.S. at prices substantially lower than domestic producers. Depending on the country of origin, these reasons may include government subsidies; illegal dumping; lower labor, raw material, energy and regulatory costs; less stringent environmental regulations; less stringent safety requirements; the maintenance of artificially low exchange rates against the U.S. dollar; and preferential trade practices in their home countries. In 2023, finished steel imports decreased 14% compared to the prior year as imports were unattractive for the majority of 2023 due to low pricing spreads between the U.S. and other regions. However, a disparity between domestic and foreign steel prices or modifications to certain trade restrictions currently in place on imported steel by government authorities could directly or indirectly impact import levels in the future. Import levels are also affected to varying degrees by the relative level of steel production in China and other countries, the strength of demand for steel outside the U.S., and the relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar against various foreign currencies. Imports of finished steel into the U.S. accounted for 21% of domestic steel market consumption in 2023. We continue to provide significant pension and healthcare benefits to a greater number of our retirees compared to certain other domestic and foreign steel producers that do not provide such benefits to any or most of their retirees, which impacts our overall cost of production relative to certain other steelmakers. However, we have taken a number of actions to reduce pension and healthcare benefits costs, including using our size and scale to proactively renegotiate lower healthcare premiums, negotiating progressive labor agreements, transferring responsibility for healthcare benefits for various groups of retirees to VEBAs, offering voluntary lump-sum settlements to pension plan participants and lowering retiree benefit costs for salaried employees. These actions have not only reduced some of the risks associated with our pension funding obligations, but more importantly have reduced our risk exposure to performance of the financial markets, which is a principal driver of pension funding requirements. We continue to actively seek opportunities to reduce pension and healthcare benefits costs. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Our operations are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. We monitor these laws and regulations, which change over time, to assess whether the changes affect our operations. We conduct our operations in a manner that is protective of public health and the environment. Environmental matters and their management continue to be an important focus at each of our operations. From 2017 to 2021, we invested approximately $1 billion into our Toledo direct reduction plant, which provides a low carbon intensity raw material to our steelmaking operations. The HBI produced from the plant requires less energy to produce compared to traditional feedstock and can be used in blast furnaces to reduce emissions by improving energy efficiency and reducing the amount of coke required for steel production. In the construction and operation of our facilities, substantial costs have been and will continue to be incurred to comply with regulatory requirements and avoid undue effect on the environment. In 2023, 2022 and 2021, our capital expenditures relating to environmental matters totaled $66 million, $133 million and $62 million, respectively. Our current estimate for capital expenditures for environmental improvements in 2024 is approximately $75 million for various water treatment, air quality, dust control, tailings management and other miscellaneous environmental projects. Additionally, we expect capital expenditures for environmental improvements for each of 2025 and 2026 to be generally in line with 2024\'s estimated spending. REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS Various governmental bodies continually promulgate new or amended laws and regulations that affect us, our customers and our suppliers in many areas, including air and water discharges, waste management and disposal, the classification of materials and products and other environmental, health and safety matters. Although we believe that our environmental policies and practices are sound and do not expect that the application of any current laws, regulations or permits would reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition, we cannot predict the collective potential adverse impact of the expanding body of laws and regulations. Moreover, because all domestic steel, scrap and mining producers operate under the same federal environmental regulations, we do not believe that we are more disadvantaged than our domestic competitors by our need to comply with these regulations. Some foreign competitors may benefit from less stringent environmental requirements in the countries where they produce, resulting in lower compliance costs for them and providing those foreign competitors with a cost advantage on their products. Specifically, there are several notable proposed or potential rulemakings or activities that could have a material adverse impact on our facilities in the future depending on their ultimate outcome: climate change and GHG regulations; changes to the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for particulate matter; changes to ozone transport regulations; selenium discharge regulation; Minnesota\'s sulfate wild rice water quality standard; Minnesota\'s mercury TMDL and mercury reduction rules; and changes to National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants in the taconite, iron and steel, and coke sectors. CLIMATE CHANGE AND GREENHOUSE GAS REGULATIONS Continued attention to issues concerning climate change, the role of human activity in affecting climate change, and potential mitigation through regulation and legislation may have a material impact on our customers and suppliers, our operations and financial results in the future. Policymakers are evaluating or developing carbon regulation at the state, regional, national and international levels. Additionally, international treaties or agreements such as the Paris Agreement may influence legislative and regulatory decisions in the U.S. Potential climate-related regulations and legislation that could impact our business include reporting obligations, such as the climate accountability package enacted in California in late 2023, mandatory carbon reductions, carbon pricing mechanisms and trade policies, such as the European Union\'s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, which entered into its transitional phase late in 2023, and climate-related procurement and product labeling requirements. The dynamic forward outlook for these potential regulations presents a challenge to large industrial companies to assess the long-term net impacts of carbon compliance costs on their operations. In the absence of comprehensive federal carbon legislation, numerous state, regional and federal regulatory initiatives are under development or are becoming effective, thereby creating a disjointed approach to GHG emissions control, potential carbon pricing and climate-related procurement activities. We intend to remain active in the discussions related to legislative and regulatory changes at the federal and state levels. Our exposure on this issue includes both the direct and indirect financial risks associated with the regulation of GHG emissions, as well as potential physical risks associated with climate change adaptation. We are continuing to review the physical risks related to climate change. As an energy-intensive business, we have a broad range of GHG emissions sources, such as iron ore furnaces and kilns, mobile equipment, EAFs and integrated steelmaking facilities, among others. As such, among our most significant regulatory risks are: (1) the costs associated with on-site emissions levels (direct impacts) or the reduction thereof; and (2) indirect costs passed through to us from energy providers and other suppliers (indirect impacts). Internationally, mechanisms to require or incentivize emissions reductions are being implemented in various countries, with differing designs and stringency, according to resources, economic structure and politics. However, some foreign competitors may benefit from less stringent climate-related requirements, providing those foreign competitors with a cost advantage on their products. Due to the potential variety of federal, state or international carbon restriction schemes, our business and customer base could suffer negative financial impacts over time as a result of increased energy, environmental and other costs to comply with the limitations that could be imposed on GHG emissions. We believe our exposure can be reduced by numerous factors, including engaging with relevant stakeholders and policymakers on potential GHG regulation and legislation; emissions reduction opportunities, such as energy efficiency, industrial electrification, carbon capture, utilization and sequestration, renewable energy and fuel flexibility, such as hydrogen; and other efficiency-improving material inputs, products and technologies. CHANGES TO NATIONAL AMBIENT AIR QUALITY STANDARDS FOR PARTICULATE MATTER On January 6, 2023, the EPA proposed changes to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for particulate matter. The proposal sought comment on lowering the primary annual fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) level from 12 micrograms per cubic meter (ug/m 3) of air to 9 – 10 ug/m 3 while taking comment on alternative annual standard levels down to 8 ug/m 3 and up to 11 ug/m 3. The EPA also proposed to retain the current primary 24-hour PM 2.5 standard of 35 ug/m 3 while soliciting comments on revising the level as low as 25 ug/m 3. The lower the standard, the greater potential effect on our operations. We actively engaged with various experts and trade associations to provide legal and technical comments on the proposal. On February 7, 2024, the EPA issued a final rule lowering the primary annual PM 2.5 standard to 9.0 ug/m 3. This standard will be final 60 days after publication in the Federal Register and will affect permitting for new or modified sources after that date. States will have three and a half years to submit State Implementation Plans to the EPA detailing how they intend to address existing sources that affect any nonattainment areas in the state. The EPA retained the current primary 24-hour PM 2.5 standard of 35 ug/m 3. The potential changes to air pollution control equipment or operations needed at our plants to comply with the new particulate matter standard are not known at this time, and the potential cost is not estimable but could be material. It is highly likely that the revised standard will be appealed, and a stay of the standard could be issued, but is uncertain. CHANGES TO OZONE TRANSPORT REGULATIONS In 2022, the EPA proposed to impose new standards for nitrogen oxide (an ozone precursor) on various industries (including the steel and iron ore sectors) that operate in specific states, including numerous states where we operate (Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia). Although there were changes in the final rule that resulted in less impact to our operations, we are appealing the final rule as it applies to reheat furnaces and boilers. If the appeal is unsuccessful, then we will have to invest in new or revised air pollution control equipment, for which the actual cost is unknown but could be material. SELENIUM DISCHARGE REGULATION In Michigan, our Empire and Tilden mines have implemented compliance plans to manage selenium according to applicable permit conditions. Construction of a water treatment system for both facilities is anticipated to begin in 2028, and the system is anticipated to be operational in 2030. As of December 31, 2023, included within our Empire asset retirement obligation is a discounted liability of approximately $131 million, which includes the estimated costs associated with the construction of Empire\'s portion of the required infrastructure and expected future operating costs of the treatment facilities. Additionally, included within our Tilden future capital plan is approximately $32 million for the construction of Tilden\'s portion of the required infrastructure. We are continuing to assess and develop potential cost effective and sustainable selenium treatment technologies. In July 2016, the EPA published new selenium fish tissue limits and lower lentic and lotic water column concentration criteria, which may someday increase the cost for treatment should the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy adopt these new standards in lieu of the existing limits required by the Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative. Accordingly, we cannot reasonably estimate the timing or long-term impact of these water quality criteria on our business. MINNESOTA\'S SULFATE WILD RICE WATER QUALITY STANDARD The Minnesota Governor established a Wild Rice Task Force by Executive Order in May 2018 that provided recommendations on wild rice restoration and regulation. The existing sulfate water quality standard for lakes and streams that contain wild rice has not been applied to any of our discharge permits or enforced historically by Minnesota. Further, the standard may be unenforceable because of legislation that prohibits the MPCA from enforcing it until the obsolete standard is updated based on modern science. Minnesota submitted a list of impaired water revisions to the EPA in 2020. In 2021, the EPA disapproved of Minnesota’s draft list and subsequently announced its proposed list of wild rice water bodies that were impaired due to sulfate under the Clean Water Act’s Section 303(d) process, which resulted in the addition of 32 waters in November 2021. At this time, it is unknown how the MPCA intends to implement requirements to address sulfate impaired waters. For these reasons, the impact of potential obligations to address sulfate concentrations in certain water discharges from our Minnesota iron ore mining and pelletizing operations is not estimable at this time, but it could have a material adverse impact if we are required to significantly reduce sulfate in certain discharges. MINNESOTA\'S MERCURY TMDL AND MERCURY REDUCTION RULES In September 2014, Minnesota promulgated the Mercury Air Emissions Reporting and Reduction Rules, mandating mercury air emissions reporting and reductions from certain sources, including taconite facilities. The rules apply to all of our Minnesota iron ore mining and pelletizing operations and required submittal of a Mercury Reduction Plan to the MPCA in 2018 with plan implementation requirements becoming effective on January 1, 2025. In the Mercury Reduction Plan, facilities evaluated if available control technologies could technically achieve a 72% mercury reduction rate. If available control technologies could not technically achieve a 72% mercury reduction rate, the facilities must propose alternative mercury reduction measures. One of the main tenets agreed upon for evaluating potential mercury reduction technologies during TMDL implementation and 2014 rule development proceedings was that the selected technology must meet the following “Adaptive Management Criteria”: the technology must be technically feasible; must be economically feasible; must not impact pellet quality; and must not cause excessive corrosion in the indurating furnaces or air pollution control equipment. The Mercury Reduction Plans for our Minnesota facilities were submitted to the MPCA in December 2018. The plans determined that there are currently no proven technologies to cost effectively reduce mercury emissions from taconite furnaces to achieve the targeted 72% reduction rate, while satisfying all Adaptive Management Criteria. This determination was based on detailed engineering analysis and research testing. In January 2023, MPCA responded that certain technologies may be appropriate, and MPCA requested submission of revised Mercury Reduction Plans from the facilities within 180 days of the effective date of the forthcoming Taconite National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants rule. Potential impacts to us are not estimable at this time because the revised Mercury Reduction Plans remain under development. RISK AND TECHNOLOGY REVIEWS FOR TACONITE, INTEGRATED IRON AND STEEL, AND COKE CATEGORIES Under the Clean Air Act, within eight years after promulgating National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants in industry-specific categories, the EPA must review the standards to determine whether they continue to protect public health with an ample margin of safety and protect against adverse environment effects. In addition, the EPA is required to review and revise the standard every eight years to account for improvements in HAP control technology or methods. The EPA has worked with the taconite and integrated iron and steel industries for years to collect data in order to recalculate the risk from HAP emissions from each category and to address whether new technologies existed in those sectors. In 2020, the EPA determined that the risk from the sources in both of those categories was acceptable and adopted new rules for both sectors in 2020. However, also in 2020, a court ruled that the EPA must address all HAPs in its National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants Risk and Technology Reviews. See Louisiana Environmental Action Network, et al. v. Environmental Protection Agency and Andrew Wheeler 955 F.3d 1088 (D.C. Cir. 2020). The EPA then reopened the rulemakings for numerous source categories, including taconite and integrated iron and steel, to confirm that all HAPs had been addressed in the updates to those rules. In 2023, the EPA determined that several HAPs are emitted from the sectors that are not yet regulated, so the EPA proposed new standards for those specific HAPs. In addition, the EPA based some proposed regulatory changes on what it deemed technological developments in the sectors. Several trade organizations commented on the proposed rules with our input, and the rules are expected to be finalized in 2024. Some proposed changes, if finalized as proposed and if upheld on appeal, could result in significant expenditures for our taconite, iron and steel, or coke oven assets. At this time the exact expenditures are unknown. We intend to use all available tools to ensure that the regulations are based on sound science and feasible technology. In 2023, the EPA likewise determined that the residual risk from coke ovens and from coke pushing, quenching, and battery stacks were low, and that no new technology developments justified changes to the regulations. However, the EPA proposed new limits on formerly unregulated HAPs and other requirements that, taken together, could require investments at our coke facilities. At this time, the amount of anticipated expenditures is unknown. OTHER GOVERNMENT LAWS AND REGULATIONS In addition to environmental laws and regulations, we are subject to various laws and regulations around the world. For example, changes in trade regulations, including tariffs or other import or export restrictions, could lead to lower or more volatile global steel prices, impacting our profitability. In addition, health and safety regulations, including OSHA and MSHA regulations, have necessitated, and may continue to necessitate, increased operating costs or capital investments to promote a safe working environment. We are also required to comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, which may include the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery laws, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation and other U.S. and foreign privacy regulations, and transportation and logistics regulations. The laws and regulations noted above, as well as other applicable laws and regulations, or the manner in which they are interpreted or enforced, may require us to make material investments in the form of additional processes, training and capital, among other things. For a discussion of the risks associated with certain applicable laws and regulations, see Part I – Item 1A. Risk Factors. RAW MATERIALS AND ENERGY Our steelmaking operations require iron ore, HBI, coke, coal, ferrous and carbon and stainless scrap, chrome, nickel, zinc and other alloys as primary raw materials. We also consume natural gas, electricity, industrial gases and diesel fuel at our operations. As a vertically integrated steel company, we are able to internally supply a majority of our ferrous raw materials needed for our steelmaking operations. We also attempt to reduce the risk of future supply shortages and price volatility in other ways. If multi-year contracts are available in the marketplace for those raw materials that we cannot supply internally, we may use these contracts to secure sufficient supply to satisfy our key raw material needs. When multi-year contracts are not available, or are not available on acceptable terms, we purchase the remainder of our raw material needs under annual contracts or conduct spot purchases. We also regularly evaluate alternative sources and substitute materials. Additionally, we may hedge portions of our energy and raw materials purchases to reduce volatility and risk. We believe that we have secured, or will be able to secure, adequate supply to fulfill our raw materials and energy requirements for 2024. The raw materials needed to produce a ton of steel will fluctuate based upon the specifications of the final steel products, the quality of raw materials and, to a lesser extent, differences among steel production equipment. For example, generally, in our integrated steelmaking facilities, we consume approximately 1.4 net tons of coal to produce one net ton of coke. The process to produce one ton of raw steel (generally defined as a carbon slab) requires approximately 1.4 net tons of iron ore pellets and/or HBI pellet equivalents, 0.3 to 0.4 net tons of coke and 0.3 net tons of steel scrap or scrap substitutes. At normal operating levels, we also consume approximately 5 to 6 MMBtu’s of natural gas per net ton of raw steel produced, prior to rolling, finishing and further processing. Additionally, on average, our EAFs require 1.1 net tons of ferrous scrap, stainless scrap or scrap substitutes to produce one net ton of steel. While these estimated consumption amounts are presented to give a general sense of raw material and energy consumption used in our steel production, substantial variations may occur. IRON ORE We own or co-own five active iron ore mines in Minnesota and Michigan. Based on our ownership in these mines, our share of annual rated iron ore production capacity is approximately 28\xa0million long tons, which supplies all of the iron ore needed for our steelmaking operations. Refer to Part I - Item 2. Properties for additional information. HBI Our investment into HBI production provides us access, when needed, to clean iron units in order to make advanced steel and stainless products. This access to our own production provides us flexibility and allows us to avoid the risks and carbon footprints of imported iron substitutes. Iron substitutes imported into the U.S. are traditionally sourced from regions of the world that have historically experienced greater political turmoil and have lower pollution standards than the U.S. Our investment demonstrates our raw material and company strategy in responsibly managing the risks of pricing, availability and overall carbon footprint of our critical inputs. We have an annual capacity of 1.9 million metric tons of HBI per year. COKE AND COAL We own three active cokemaking facilities, including one coke plant located within our Burns Harbor facility. These facilities currently provide approximately half of the coke requirements for our steelmaking operations and have an annual rated capacity of 2.6 million net tons. Additionally, we have coke supply agreements with suppliers that provide our remaining requirements. Our purchases of coke are made under annual or multi-year agreements with periodic price adjustments. We have annual rated metallurgical coal production capacity of 1.8\xa0million net tons from our Princeton mine, which supplies a portion of our metallurgical coal needs. We typically purchase most of our metallurgical coal under annual fixed price agreements. We believe there are adequate external supplies of coke and coal available at competitive market prices to meet our needs. Refer to Part I - Item 2. Properties for additional information. STEEL SCRAP We own the assets of FPT, which provides us sourcing and processing capabilities for both prime and obsolete scrap. This access is critical, because prime scrap demand is expected to grow as new flat-rolled EAF capacity has started to come online and is expected to increase in the coming years. FPT includes 22 facilities that are primarily located in the Midwest near our steel facilities. Additionally, our access to scrap furthers our commitment to being an environmentally-friendly, low-carbon intensity steelmaker with a cleaner materials mix as we are able to better optimize productivity at our existing EAFs and BOFs. The majority of our scrap requirements can be generated or processed from internal sources, including scrap generated at our steel production facilities. We believe that supplies of additional steel scrap to meet the needs of our steelmaking operations are readily available from outside sources at competitive market prices. OTHER MATERIALS We believe that supplies of chrome, nickel, zinc and other alloys adequate to meet the needs of our steelmaking operations are readily available from outside sources at competitive market prices. ENERGY We consume a large amount of natural gas, electricity, industrial gases and diesel fuel, which are significant costs to our operations. The majority of our energy requirements are purchased from outside sources. Access to long-term, low-cost sources of energy in various forms is critically important to our operations. Natural gas is procured for our operations utilizing a combination of long-term, annual, quarterly, monthly and spot contracts from various suppliers at market-based pricing. We believe access to low-cost and reliable sources of natural gas is available to meet our operations’ requirements. We purchase electricity for all of our operations in either regulated or deregulated markets. Due to the distinct nature of the regulated market, we procure electricity through either long-term or annual contracts. In deregulated markets, we purchase the majority of our electricity in the day-ahead market. Some of our operations also use self-generated coke oven gas and/or blast furnace gas to produce electricity, which is an environmentally-friendly practice that also reduces our need to purchase electricity from external sources. We also closely monitor developments at the state and federal levels that could impact electricity availability or cost and incorporate such changes into our electricity supply strategy in order to maintain reliable, low-cost supply. We also are currently contracting for the increased use of renewable energy to complement our existing supply, which will reduce our emis', url='https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/764065/000076406524000038/clf-20231231.htm'), ExaOutput(text='U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Washington, D.C. 20549 FORM ANNUAL REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF\nTHE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 For the Year Ended Commission File Number: (Exact Name of Small Business Issuer as Specified\nin its Charter) STANDARD METALS PROCESSING, INC.

These forward-looking statements reflect our\njudgment as of the date of this Annual Report with respect to future events, the outcome of which is subject to risks, which may have\na significant impact on our business, operating results and/or financial condition. Readers are cautioned that these forward-looking statements\nare inherently uncertain. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect,\nactual results or outcomes may vary materially from those described herein. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements.\nThe risks identified in Item 1A, among others, may impact forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report. ITEM 1. BUSINESS \xa0 Business Overview \xa0 General American Clean Resources Group,\nInc. f/k/a Standard Metals Processing, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” “ACRG” or the “Company”)\nis an exploration stage company having offices in Lakewood, Colorado and, through its subsidiaries, a property in Tonopah, Nevada. Our\nbusiness plan is to purchase equipment and build a facility on our Tonopah property to serve as a permitted custom processing toll milling\nfacility (which includes an analytical lab, pyrometallurgical plant, and hydrometallurgical recovery plant). The Company plans to perform\npermitted custom processing toll milling, which is a process whereby mined material is crushed and ground into fine particles to ease\nthe extraction of any precious minerals contained therein, such as minerals in the gold, silver, and platinum metal groups. Custom milling\nand refining can include many different processes that are designed specifically for each ore load and to maximize the extraction of precious\nmetals from carbon or concentrates. These toll-processing services also distill, dry, mix, or mill chemicals and bulk materials on a contractual\nbasis and provide a chemical production outsourcing option for industrial companies, which lack the expertise, capacity, or regulatory\npermits for in-house production. We are required to obtain\nseveral permits before we can begin construction of a small-scale mineral processing facility to conduct permitted processing toll milling\nactivities and construction of the required additional buildings for us to commence operations. Any reference herein to “ACRG”\n“the Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us” is intended to mean American Clean Resources Group,\nInc., a Nevada corporation, and all of our subsidiaries unless otherwise indicated. Corporate History The Company was incorporated\nin the State of Colorado on July 10, 1985, as Princeton Acquisitions, Inc. On December 7, 2009, the Company changed its name to Standard\nGold, Inc. Effective March 5, 2013, the Company moved its domicile from Colorado to Nevada and changed its name from Standard Gold, Inc.\nto Standard Gold Holdings, Inc. In 2013, the Company changed its name to Standard Metals Processing, Inc., and coincident with announcing\nits plans to acquire 80.1 % of the SMS Group during 2022, changed its name to American Clean Resources Group, Inc. to more accurately\nreflect the business plans contemplated by the Company, and relocated its administrative offices into those adjacent to Granite Peak Resources,\nLLC (“GPR”), an ACRG affiliate. (see “ Recent Actions ” below for further information regarding the SMS Group). On March 15, 2011, we closed\na series of transactions, whereby we acquired certain assets of Shea Mining &amp; Milling, LLC (“Shea Mining”), which assets\ninclude land, buildings, a dormant milling facility, abandoned milling equipment, water permits, mine tailings, mine dumps and the assignment\nof a note payable, a lease and a contract agreement with permits. We completed the Shea Exchange Agreement to acquire the Shea assets\nto develop a permitted custom processing toll milling of precious minerals business in Tonopah, Nevada. Toll milling is a process whereby\nmined material is crushed and ground into fine particles to ease the extraction of any precious minerals contained therein, such as gold,\nsilver, and platinum group metals. Custom milling and refining can include many different processes to extract precious metals from carbon\nor concentrates. These toll-processing services also distil, dry, mix, or mill chemicals and bulk materials on a contractual basis and\nprovide a chemical production outsourcing option for industrial companies which lack the expertise, capacity, or regulatory permits for\nin-house production. The land encompasses 1,183 deeded acres, one of the largest private land holdings in Esmeralda County, Nevada. Approximately\n334 acres of this land has an estimated 2.2 million tons of tailings known as the Millers Tailings from the historic gold rush of Goldfield\nand Tonopah, Nevada sitting on it. 1\xa0 Subsidiaries The Company has one wholly\nowned subsidiary, Aurielle Enterprises, Inc. f/k/a/ Tonopah Milling and Metals Group, Inc. (“AE”), a Nevada corporation. AE\nhas two wholly owned subsidiaries, Tonopah Resources, Inc., a Nevada corporation and Tonopah Custom Processing, Inc., a Nevada corporation. Products and Services We seek to establish ourselves\nas a custom processing and permitted toll milling service provider. Our business plan is to build a facility on our Tonopah property,\nwhich includes an analytical lab, pyrometallurgical, and hydrometallurgical recovery plant. The Company’s intention\nis to become a full service permitted custom toll milling and processing company that facilitates the extraction of precious and strategic\nminerals from mined material. The Company will need to obtain permits for the planned construction and operation of our permitted custom\nprocessing toll milling facility with state-of-the-art equipment capable of processing gold, silver and platinum metal groups. Many junior\nminers do not have the capital or the ability to permit a processing facility, yet they have a large supply of mined material that requires\nmilling be performed. It is often cost prohibitive or impractical for these mine operators to send their materials to processing mills\nowned by the large mining companies, or to other customers badly needing milling and processing services. While Nevada has a historic\nrole as a mining center with good proximate geology and ample mined product, very little custom processing toll milling capacity remains\nin the state. During the last several decades, other processing facilities have been shuttered due to high costs of regulations and the\nvertical integration of milling within large mining companies leaving junior miners with few options for local milling services. As a\nresult, we are in a unique position among processing facilities because we are capable of true permitted custom processing. We have the\nonly ball mill located within a custom toll milling facility within 300 miles allowing us to serve miners in the western United States,\nCanada, Mexico, and Central America. Many junior miners are undercapitalized,\nhave limited access to capital markets and have a large supply of mined material that requires milling be performed. Many large mining\ncompanies reserve their milling capacity for their inventory, which does not make providing third party services worthwhile. This provides\nthe Company with an opportunity to provide these potential customers with badly needed milling and processing services. Some of our mining\ncustomers will be able to take their tailings (the material left over after the desired minerals have been extracted) from the material\nthey deposited with the Company and put it back in the exact same mines those particular tailings came from. This eliminates the need\nfor the Company to dispose of those tailings. Water Pollution Control Permit with Nevada\nDepartment of Environmental Protection Through Tonopah Custom Processing,\nInc. (“TCP”), a Water Pollution Control Permit (“WPCP”) Application was filed with the Nevada Department of Environmental\nProtection (“NDEP”) Bureau of Mines and Mining Reclamation (“BMMR”) for the approval of the permits necessary\nfor a small-scale mineral processing facility planned for the Tonopah property. The plant will perform laboratory testing, pilot testing,\nand custom processing of precious metal ores and concentrates from mining industry clients. Processing of ore materials will employ standard\nmineral processing techniques including gravity concentration, froth flotation and chemical leaching and carbon stripping. The WPCP must be approved\nprior to commencing the planned construction of our processing plant in Tonopah, Nevada. While the Company awaits approval, we are preparing\nfor construction of our processing facility which includes working with contractors that will be building the planned 21,875 square foot\nprocessing plant, cleaning and preparing the property, and refurbishing a trailer that will act as our construction office. In connection with our WPCP\napplication, NDEP suggested that we take the following actions: (i) retain a Nevada Certified Environmental Manager (“CEM”),\n(ii) perform Meteoric Profile II water testing on ground water directly below the mill as well as surrounding wells located off site,\nand (iii) determine baseline values of water using the Meteoric Profile II results. NDEP regulations require that the Company delay any\nnew construction planned for “metal extraction” until after the permits are in place. 2\xa0 Survey Advanced Surveying &amp; Professional\nServices, a Professional Land Surveyor (“PLS”), completed surveys and testing of the Tonopah property required for the application\nof our required permits. After completion of the survey, it was determined the property is 1,183 acres. The scope of work the PLS completed\nincludes: (i) setting a total of 19 permanent monuments at angle points along lines, (ii) setting eight permanent monuments locating US\nHwy 95, (iii) recording a professional map indicating longitude and latitude for all corners, and (iv) providing a digital map accessible\nin Auto Cad software. Site Preparation We have completed the initial\ngrading of specific designated areas on the 40 undisturbed acres of land including clearing all vegetation, removing of all scrap metal,\nand the excavation of the building pad for the preparation of the new 21,875 square foot processing plant and have completed the removal\nof all the extra and unnecessary materials and old equipment that has accumulated on the land. Toll Milling Toll milling is a process\nwhereby mined material is crushed and ground into fine particles to ease the extraction of any precious minerals contained therein, such\nas minerals in the gold, silver and platinum metal groups. Custom milling and refining that are designed specifically for each ore load\ncan include many different processes to maximize the extraction of precious metals from ore, carbon, or concentrates.\xa0 Procedure Ore is sent to our facility\nat the responsibility and cost of the customer. The Company will take a sample of the ore through a specific ore sampling procedure. The\nCompany’s metallurgist will test the sample on site. To obtain a quantitative determination of the amount of a given substance in\na particular sample, the Company can perform wet methods and dry methods. In the wet method, the sample is dissolved in a reagent, like\nacid, until the purified metal is separated out. In the dry method, the sample is mixed with a flux (a substance such as borax or silica\nthat helps lower the melting temperature) and then heated so that the impurities in the metal fuse with the flux, leaving the purified\nmetal as residue. If it is determined that the\nsample is approved for processing, the customer and the Company will then agree upon a value of the metal grade per ton. If there is any\ndisagreement on the value, a third-party referee determines the value by testing the sample. The Company charges either a flat fee per\nton of the ore processed or a percentage of the precious metals extracted during processing, or a combination of both based on the amount\nof work that is performed. There are various methods\nof extraction. The Company determines which method to use based upon the sample sent to the Company. In most situations, a series of tests\nwill be performed on a bulk sample ranging in size from 250 to 1,000 pounds. A metallurgist will determine the best process or processes\nto use for the extraction based on several factors. These include the composition of the host rock, mineralization of the host rock, whether\nor not it is an oxide or sulfide ore body, and the particle size of the precious metal. After the metallurgist reviews these characteristics,\nthe Company will run ore on a gold table and assays the concentrates, middlings, and tails. An assay is an investigative procedure for\nqualitatively assessing or quantitatively measuring the presence, or amount of, precious metals in ore. If there is too much gold in the\nmiddling or tails, the size of the grind is adjusted to increase yield or if there is not enough gold in the middlings or tails the Company\ngrinds the material to a finer mesh.\xa0 Some of our miner customers\nwill be able to take their tailings (the material left over after the desired minerals have been extracted) from the material they deposited\nwith the Company and put it back in the exact same mines those particular tailings came from. This eliminates the need for the Company\nto dispose of those tailings. 3\xa0 Concentrate/Leach Circuit Concentration is the separation\nof precious minerals from other materials by utilizing different properties of the minerals to be separated including density, magnetic\nor electric and physiochemical. The Company will attempt to create a “concentrate” of minerals to reduce the size of each\nton processed. The Company may also receive concentrates from customers, especially those where transport of tons of raw ore is not feasible. The leaching process uses\nchemicals to extract the metals from the solid materials (concentrates) and bring them into a solution. Once the metals are in the solution,\nit is passed through carbon or resin columns where the precious metals are deposited onto the carbon/resin. The metals will then be stripped\nfrom the carbon back into a different solution where they are pumped through an electrowinning circuit in a process called carbon stripping.\nThe metals are then deposited onto stainless steel in the electrowinning circuit. After this stage, the metals are either sold or further\nrefined off-site. The solution is recycled and used again to process additional material. Recent Actions On\nJanuary 10, 2022 the Company executed a definitive agreement to acquire a controlling interest in Sustainable Metal Solutions LLC (“SMS”).\nThe purchase price for the controlling interest in SMS will be determined based upon the price of ACRG common stock on the date of closing,\nsuch date to be decided by the Parties in good faith after all conditions precedent are met. SMS is an American multi-company environmental\ndevelopment platform focused on producing carbon neutral precious metals and minerals thereby driving American mineral independence while\nrevitalizing the environment and minimizing the impacts of climate change. The business of SMS is consistent with the Company’s\nposture to acquire, license or joint venture with other parties involved in toll milling, processing, or mining related activities, which\nmay include GPR and its affiliated entities, including, but not limited to, NovaMetallix. Inc., and BlackBear Natural Resources, LTD. Employees As\nof December 31, 2022, we did not have any employees. The Company’s and its subsidiaries’ officers, directors and independent\ncontractors conduct all operations. Available Information You can request a free copy\nof our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed\nor furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such\nmaterial, or furnish it to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) the above filings by writing or calling us at our\nprincipal executive offices, the address and telephone number for which are set forth on the cover page of this Form 10-K for the year\nended December 31, 2022.\xa0\xa0\xa0 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS An investment in our common\nstock is highly speculative and involves a high degree of risk. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the\nrisks described below together with all of the other information included in this prospectus. The statements contained in or incorporated\ninto this prospectus that are not historic facts are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could\ncause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in or implied by forward-looking statements. If any of the following risks\nactually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed. In that case, the value of our common stock\ncould decline, and an investor in our securities may lose all or part of their investment. Risks Related to Our Capital Stock INVESTORS MAY BE UNABLE TO ACCURATELY VALUE\nOUR COMMON STOCK. Investors often value companies\nbased on the stock prices and results of operations of other comparable companies. Currently, we do not believe another publicly traded\npermitted custom processing toll milling company exists that is directly comparable to our size and scale. Prospective investors, therefore,\nhave limited historical information about our permitted custom processing toll milling capabilities on which to base an evaluation of\nour performance and prospects and an investment in our common stock. As such, investors may find it difficult to accurately value our\ncommon stock. 4\xa0 INVESTORS MAY FACE SIGNIFICANT RESTRICTIONS\nON THE RESALE OF OUR COMMON STOCK DUE TO FEDERAL REGULATION OF PENNY STOCKS. The SEC has defined any equity\nsecurity with a market price of less than $5.00 per share as a “penny stock.” Penny stocks are subject to the requirements\nor Rule 15(g)-9 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our common stock is quoted on the Over the Counter (“OTC”) Markets\nunder the symbol ACRG and despite recent trading prices above $5.00 per share, has historically been below $5.00 per share. Therefore,\nour common stock is deemed a “penny stock” and is subject to the requirements of Rule 15(g)-9. Under such rule, broker-dealers\nwho recommend low-priced securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors must satisfy special sales practice\nrequirements, including a requirement that they make an individualized written suitability determination for the purchaser and receive\nthe purchaser’s consent prior to the transaction. The required penny stock disclosures include the delivery, prior to any transaction,\nof a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated with it. Such requirements could severely limit the\nmarket liquidity of the securities and the ability of purchasers to sell their securities in the secondary market. WE DO NOT INTEND TO PAY DIVIDENDS FOR THE FORESEEABLE\nFUTURE. We have never declared or\npaid any dividends on our common stock. We intend to retain all of our earnings, if any, for the foreseeable future to finance the operation\nand expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the future. Our Board of Directors retains the discretion\nto change this policy.\xa0 THE MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK MAY FLUCTUATE. Currently, our common stock\nis traded on the Over the Counter (“OTC”) Market. Stock prices on the OTC Markets can be more volatile than stocks trading\non national market systems such as NSADAQ, NYSE or AMEX. Our stock price may be affected by factors outside of our control and unrelated\nto our business operations. Risks Related to Our Financial Condition \xa0 WE CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH CASH TO FUND\nOPERATIONS AND/OR REDUCE OUR DEBT DURING 2023. We have very limited funds,\nand such funds are not adequate to develop our current business plan, or even to satisfy our existing working capital requirements. We\nwill be required to raise additional funds to effectuate our current business plan for permitted custom processing toll milling and to\nsatisfy our working capital requirements. Without significant additional capital, we will be unable to start operations. With respect\nto our proposed permitted custom processing toll milling operations, the costs and ability to successfully operate have not been fully\nverified because none of our proposed tolling operations have begun and we may incur unexpected costs or delays in connection with starting\noperations. The cost of designing and building our operations and of finding customers and sources of ore for our toll milling sources\ncan be extensive and will require us to obtain additional financing, and there is no assurance that we will have the resources necessary\nor the financing available to attain operations or to acquire customers and ore sources necessary for our long-term business. Our ultimate\nsuccess will depend on our ability to raise additional capital. Additionally, such additional capital may not be available to us at acceptable\nterms or at all. Further, if we increase our capitalization and sell additional shares of our capital stock, a shareholder’s position\nin our Company will be subject to dilution. In the event we are unable to obtain additional capital, we may be forced to cease our search\nfor additional business opportunities, reduce our operating expenditures or to cease operations altogether. WE HAVE NOT YET BEGUN OPERATIONS AND WE EXPECT\nTO INCUR LOSSES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. We have yet to commence active\noperations. We have no prior operating history from which to evaluate our success, or our likelihood of success in operating our business,\ngenerating any revenues, or achieving profitability. This provides a limited basis for you to assess our ability to commercialize our\nservices and the advisability of investing in our securities. We have not generated revenue from our toll milling services to date and\nthere can be no assurance that our plans for permitted custom processing toll milling will be successful, or that we will ever attain\nsignificant revenue or profitability. Also, toll milling is a new area of business for us, and our management team has little experience\nin permitted custom processing toll milling operations. Although we intend to hire knowledgeable and experienced employees and/or consultants\nwith significant experience in toll milling operations, there is no guarantee that we will reach profitability in the near future, if\nat all. As we develop our Tonopah property to prepare for operations, we are subject to unforeseen costs, expenses, problems and difficulties\ninherent in new business ventures. 5\xa0 OUR MANAGEMENT HAS SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT\nOUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. The financial statements for each of these periods were prepared assuming\nthat we would continue as a going concern. We have had net losses for each of the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, and we have\nan accumulated a deficit as of December 31, 2022, of $106,530,496. Virtually all of the Company’s assets are encumbered or pledged\nunder senior secured debt that is in default. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nFurthermore, since we do not expect to generate any significant revenues from operations for the foreseeable future, our ability to continue\nas a going concern depends, in large part, on our ability to raise additional capital through equity or debt financing transactions. If\nwe are unable to raise additional capital, we may be forced to discontinue our business. Risks Related to the Company \xa0 WE HAVE LIMITED ASSETS. Our assets to be used in the\ndevelopment of a toll milling service have not yet been utilized, we will need to acquire additional equipment and construct additional\nfacilities and there can be no guarantee that we will be successful in utilizing our current assets or obtaining the additional equipment\nand facilities that we will need to operate going forward. We do not anticipate having any revenues from our permitted custom toll milling\nprocessing for the foreseeable future. Additionally, without adequate funding, we may never produce any significant revenues. OUR MAJOR ASSETS ARE ENCUMBERED UNDER A DEED\nOF TRUST OR PLEDGED. The Tonopah property is subject\nto a first deed of trust securing a $2,500,000 promissory note in default and a $5,000,000 Line of Credit held by GPR, a related party.\nAt December 31, 2022, the outstanding principal and accrued interest amounts are $2,229,187 and $1,689,685, respectively. In addition,\nthe Company entered into a Forbearance Agreement with GPR effective December 20, 2019. GPR agreed to forbear any foreclosure proceedings\nfor six months in exchange for the Company pledging the stock of its subsidiary and its subsidiaries as additional collateral under its\noutstanding obligations. The Forbearance Agreement expired June 30, 2020 and has not been renewed. On March 16, 2020 the Company\nexecuted a Line of Credit (“LOC”) with GPR, a related party, evidenced by a promissory note. The original LOC was for $5,000,000,\nmaturing March 16, 2025, but may be increased by another $5,000,000 and extended another five years, and is secured by the Company’s\nreal and personal property GPR already has under lien. The Company entered into an Amendment and Forbearance Agreement with GPR on January\n5, 2023 wherein GPR agreed to: (a) increase the existing LOC from $5,000,000 due March 16, 2025 to $35,000,000 due March 16, 2027, (b)\nroll two existing promissory notes purchased by GPR into the LOC resulting in the extinguishment of such notes as separate instruments,\nand (c) to forebear until January 12, 2024, on exercising its foreclosure rights under its defaulted Senior Secured Note. The Company’s\nBoard of Directors approved a revision in the conversion price at which the LOC may convert into the Company’s common stock from\n$1.65 per share to $1.05 per share, based upon the market price of the Company’s common stock over the 3 days preceding the agreement.\nGPR is the Company’s majority shareholder and largest debtholder. GPR holds a senior secured interest in all of the assets of the\nCompany, including the stock of its subsidiary entities. OUR MANAGEMENT TEAM MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY\nIMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS STRATEGIES. If our management team is\nunable to execute our business strategies, then our development could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we may encounter\ndifficulties in effectively managing the budgeting, forecasting and other process control issues presented by any future growth. We may\nseek to augment or replace members of our management team or we may lose key members of our management team, and we may not be able to\nattract new management talent with sufficient skill and experience. OUR SUCCESS IN THE FUTURE MAY DEPEND ON OUR\nABILITY TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN STRATEGIC ALLIANCES, AND ANY FAILURE ON OUR PART TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN SUCH RELATIONSHIPS WOULD\nADVERSELY AFFECT OUR MARKET PENETRATION AND REVENUE GROWTH. We may be required to establish\nstrategic relationships with third parties in the mining and toll milling industries. Our ability to establish strategic relationships\nwill depend on a number of factors, many of which are outside our control, such as the suitability of our property, facilities and equipment\nrelative to our competitors, or the quality grade of precious minerals we are able to extract from the ore we process. We can provide\nno assurance that we will be able to establish strategic relationships in the future. 6\xa0 In addition, any strategic\nalliances that we establish, will subject us to a number of risks, including risks associated with sharing proprietary information, loss\nof control of operations that are material to developed business and profit-sharing arrangements. Moreover, strategic alliances may be\nexpensive to implement and subject us to the risk that the third party will not perform its obligations under the relationship, which\nmay subject us to losses over which we have no control or expensive termination arrangements. As a result, even if our strategic alliances\nwith third parties are successful, our business may be adversely affected by a number of factors that are outside of our control. Risks Relating to Our Business WE WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FINANCING TO FUND\nOUR PERMITTED CUSTOM PROCESSING TOLL MILLING DEVELOPMENT AND OPERATIONS. Substantial additional financing\nwill be needed to fund the current plan to begin toll milling services and develop and maintain the Tonopah property. Our means of acquiring\ninvestment capital is limited to private equity and debt transactions. We have no significant sources of currently available funds to\nengage in additional development. Without significant additional capital, we will be unable to fund our current property interests or\neffectuate our current business plan for permitted custom processing toll milling and mining services. See “—Risks Relating\nto Our Financial Condition – We Currently Do Not Have Enough Cash to Fund Operations, and/or Reduce Debt During 2023”. OUR PERFORMANCE MAY BE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS IN MINERAL PRICES. The profitability of any permitted\ncustom processing toll milling services could be significantly affected by changes in the market price of minerals. Demand for minerals\ncan be influenced by economic conditions and attractiveness as an investment vehicle. Other factors include the level of interest rates,\nexchange rates and inflation. The aggregate effect of these factors is impossible to predict with accuracy. In particular, mine production\nand the willingness of third parties such as central banks to sell or lease gold affects the supply of gold. Worldwide production levels\nalso affect mineral prices. In addition, the price of gold, silver and other precious minerals have, on occasion, been subject to very\nrapid short-term changes due to speculative activities. OUR PERMITTED CUSTOM PROCESSING TOLL MILLING\nOPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS AND PERMITTING, WHICH COULD RESULT IN THE INCURRENCE OF ADDITIONAL COSTS AND OPERATIONAL\nDELAYS. All phases of our operations\nare subject to current environmental protection regulation. There is no assurance that future changes in environmental regulation, such\nas greenhouse gas emissions, carbon footprint and the like, will not adversely affect our operations. Some of our proposed operations\nwill require additional permits, which could incur additional cost and may delay start up and cash flow. In addition, each toll milling\nmineral source must be fully permitted for its own operation, a process over which we have no control. OUR PERMITTED CUSTOM PROCESSING TOLL MILLING\nOPERATIONS WILL REQUIRE US TO DEPEND ON THIRD PARTIES AND OTHER ELEMENTS BEYOND OUR CONTROL, WHICH COULD RESULT IN HARM TO OUR BUSINESS. Our permitted custom processing\ntoll milling operations will rely on mineral material produced by others, and we have no control over their operations. Delivery of ore\nto our processing facilities is also subject to the risks of transportation, including trucking and aviation operations run by others,\nregulations and permits, fuel cost, weather, and travel conditions. Toll milling requires that the mineral producer and the mineral processor\nagree on the grade of the incoming material, which can be a source of conflict between parties. Although a third party will be utilized\nfor any such conflict, any disagreements with mineral producers, or problems with the delivery of ore, could result in additional costs,\ndisruptions and other problems in the operation of our business. 7\xa0 U.S. FEDERAL LAWS Under the U.S. Resource Conservation\nand Recovery Act, companies such as ours may incur costs for generating, transporting, treating, storing, or disposing of hazardous waste.\nOur permitted custom processing toll milling operations may produce air emissions, including fugitive dust and other air pollutants, from\nstationary equipment, storage facilities, and the use of mobile sources such as trucks and heavy construction equipment which are subject\nto review, monitoring and/or control requirements under the Federal Clean Air Act and state air quality laws. Permitting rules may impose\nlimitations on our production levels or create additional capital expenditures in order to comply with the rules. The U.S. Comprehensive Environmental\nResponse Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (CERCLA) imposes strict joint and several liability on parties associated\nwith releases or threats of releases of hazardous substances. The groups who could be found liable include, among others, the current\nowners and operators of facilities which release hazardous substances into the environment and past owners and operators of properties\nwho owned such properties at the time the disposal of the hazardous substances occurred. This liability could include the cost of removal\nor remediation of the release and damages for injury to the surrounding property. We cannot predict the potential for future CERCLA liability\nwith respect to our property. THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKET MAY HAVE IMPACTS\nON OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION THAT WE CURRENTLY CANNOT PREDICT. The global financial market,\nespecially the precious metal market and its market price fluctuations have, and may continue to have, an impact on our business and our\nfinancial condition. We may face significant challenges if the price of the minerals we intend to process do not achieve or stay at adequate\nprice levels. Our ability to access the capital markets may be severely restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to access such\nmarkets, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. The market price of ores,\nmetals and precious metals could have an impact on any potential lenders or investors or on our customers, causing them to fail to meet\ntheir obligations to us.\xa0 ITEM 2. PROPERTIES On March 15, 2011, in an effort\nto enter the precious metal toll milling business, we completed the Shea Exchange Agreement, whereby we acquired the Tonopah property,\nconsisting of land, buildings, mining tailings, a dormant milling facility, abandoned milling equipment and water permits. Our Tonopah property consists\nof 1,183 acres of land, buildings, mining tailings, a dormant milling facility, abandoned milling equipment and water permits. The Tonopah\nproperty was transferred to Aurielle Enterprises Inc f/k/a Tonopah Milling and Metals Group, Inc. (“AE”), the Company’s\nwholly owned subsidiary and then transferred to Tonopah Resources, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of AE. During 2022, our corporate\noffice was relocated to 10567 West Cedar Drive, Suite 105, Lakewood, Colorado 80228-2039, a commercial office building owned and operated\nby GPR’s affiliates. We believe that our facilities are adequate for our current needs and are in closer physical proximity to our\nproperty. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Stephen E. Flechner v. Standard Metals Processing,\nInc. On August 12, 2015 the United\nStated District Court for the District of Colorado issued a judgment in favor of Stephen E. Flechner for $2,157,000. An amended final\njudgment was ordered in adjudication of the Complaint by the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado (the “Court”)\non August 28, 2015 in favor of Flechner in the amount of $2,157,000, plus interest through the date of judgment of $235,246, plus interest\nof $472.76/day from August 28, 2015 until paid in full. The Company has recognized the daily interest due from the date of the August\n28, 2015 judgment through December 31, 2022, totaling $1,311,490, resulting in a total amount of $3,703,736 being included in the accrual\nfor settlement of lawsuits relating to this matter in the accompanying December 31, 2022 consolidated balance sheet. On November 29, 2021, the\nCompany was notified that its majority shareholder, GPR, had executed definitive documents with Stephen Flechner to acquire his judgment\nagainst the Company. Documents have been filed with the Court to reflect this acquisition. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES \xa0 Not applicable.\xa0 8\xa0 PART II ITEM 5.

ITEM 6. [RESERVED] ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should\nbe read in conjunction with the Financial Statements of the Company and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report. See “Consolidated\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data.” 9\xa0 Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward Looking\nStatements Readers are cautioned that\nthe following discussion contains certain forward-looking statements and should be read in conjunction with the “Special Note Regarding\nForward-Looking Statements” appearing at the beginning of this Annual Report.

Water Pollution Control Permit Through the Company’s\nsubsidiaries, a Water Pollution Control Permit (“WPCP”) Application will need to be filed with the Nevada Department of Environmental\nProtection (“NDEP”) Bureau of Mines and Mining Reclamation (“BMMR”) for the approval of the permits necessary\nfor a small-scale mineral processing facility planned for the Tonopah Property. The plant will perform laboratory testing, pilot testing,\nand custom processing of precious metal ores and concentrates from mining industry clients. Processing of ore materials will employ standard\nmineral processing techniques including gravity concentration, froth flotation and chemical leaching and carbon stripping. The WPCP must be approved\nprior to commencing the planned construction of our processing plant in Tonopah, Nevada. In connection with the WPCP\napplication, NDEP suggested that we take the following actions: (i) retain a Nevada Certified Environmental Manager (“CEM”),\n(ii) perform Meteoric Profile II water testing on ground water directly below the mill as well as surrounding wells located off site,\nand (iii) determine baseline values of water using the Meteoric Profile II results. NDEP regulations require that the Company delay any\nnew construction planned for “metal extraction” until after the permits are in place. Advanced Surveying &amp; Professional\nServices, a Professional Land Surveyor (“PLS”), completed surveys and testing of the Tonopah property required for the application\nof our required permits. After completion of the survey, it was determined the property is 1,186 acres. The scope of work the PLS completed\nincludes: (i) setting a total of 19 permanent monuments at angle points along lines, (ii) setting eight permanent monuments locating US\nHwy 95, (iii) recording a professional map indicating longitude and latitude for all corners, and (iv) providing a digital map accessible\nin AutoCAD software. 10\xa0 Site Preparation We have completed the initial\ngrading of specific designated areas on the 40 undisturbed acres of land including clearing all vegetation, removing of all scrap metal,\nand the excavation of the building pad for the preparation of the new 21,875 square foot processing plant and have completed the removal\nof all the extra and unnecessary materials and old equipment that have accumulated on the land. We refurbished a trailer that will act\nas our construction office. Business Plan The Company is re-examining\nits next steps for developing a processing facility. In an effort to move the Company’s business plan forward, Management may evaluate\nopportunities to acquire, license or joint venture with other parties, which may include related parties, involved in toll milling, processing,\nor mining related activities. The Company is re-examining its next steps for developing a processing facility. In an effort to move the\nCompany’s business plan forward, Management may evaluate opportunities to acquire, license or joint venture with other parties,\nwhich may include related parties, involved in toll milling, processing, or mining related activities, which may include GPR and its affiliated\nentities including, but not limited to Sustainable Metal Solutions, LLC (See – “ Recent Actions ” above), NovaMetallix.\nInc., and BlackBear Natural Resources, LTD. On March 27, 2020, the Company\nengaged NovaMetallix. Inc. (“NMX”), a member of the Sustainable Metal Solutions Group, a GPR affiliate, to conduct a study\nof the quantity and quality of our historic mine tailings, and the economic feasibility of processing them to reclaim their residual content\nof gold, silver, and other valuable metals.\xa0 NMX, a firm comprised of world class mining, geological and metallurgical engineering\nprofessionals, is dedicated to the rapidly developing field of sustainable metal recovery.\xa0 NMX has agreed to conduct the study of\nthe Company’s tailings in exchange for GPR’s agreement to underwrite its cost and expense, and the exclusive right to process\nthe tailings should their economic assessment prove positive.\xa0The terms of such processing to be mutually agreed upon in the future\nbased on the results of the assessment.\xa0 Reverse Stock Split Effective May 18, 2021, the\nCompany effected a reverse stock split of the outstanding Common Stock, on the basis of one share\nfor every fifty shares currently issued and outstanding. Results of Operations Comparison of the Years Ended December 31,\n2022, and December 31, 2021 Revenues We had no revenues from any\noperations for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Furthermore, we do not anticipate any significant future revenue until we have\nsufficiently funded construction and begin operations. General and Administrative\nExpenses General and administrative\nexpenses were $323,940 for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to $681,939 for the same period in 2021. For the year ended December\n31, 2022, general and administrative expenses and professional fees were severely cut due to lack of funding. During the year ended December\n31, 2021, the nature of expenses were relatively the same, however we were able to incur and pay normal professional and legal fees and\nother necessary expenses due to greater availability of funds. We anticipate that future administration and operating expenses will increase\nfor fiscal 2023 as we continue to build the infrastructure to proceed with our planned custom processing toll milling services. Other Income and Expenses Each year we receive monthly payments of approximately $700 per month,\ntotaling $8,396 per year, from American Tower Corporation for a cellular tower located on our Tonopah land. In addition, during the year\nended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized gains due to the write off of numerous accrued claims that were no longer enforceable\nor settled for less than face amount aggregating $15,137. There were similar no longer enforceable claims written off during the year\nended December 31, 2021, totaling $226,645. 11\xa0 Interest expense for the year\nended December 31, 2022, was $752,233 compared to $680,555 for the respective period in 2021. The $71,678 increase during 2022 compared\nto 2021 is primarily due to interest due at rates ranging from 6% to 10% on notes payable to related parties and our increasing balances\nof convertible promissory notes outstanding during both periods. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity is a measure of\nan entity’s ability to secure enough cash to meet its contractual and operating needs as they arise. We have funded our operations\nand satisfied our capital requirements principally through increases in our LOC with GPR. We do not anticipate generating sufficient positive\ncash flows from our operations to fund the next 12 months. We had a working capital deficit of $12,350,048, at December 31, 2022. Cash\nwas $1,251, at December 31, 2022, as compared to cash of $2,363 at December 31, 2021. Our cash reserves will not\nbe adequate to meet our operational needs and thus, we need to raise additional capital to pay for our operational expenses and provide\nfor capital expenditures. Our basic operational expenses are currently approximately $32,000 per month, without regard to accrued interest\nof approximately $63,000 per month. Above our basic monthly expenses, we estimate that we need $50,000,000 to begin limited toll milling\noperations. If we are not able to raise additional working capital, we may have to cease operations altogether. Recent Financings During the year ended December\n31, 2022, GPR, a related party, advanced $314,433 pursuant to a secured line of credit in direct payments on the Company’s behalf\nto reduce certain accounts payable. The balance due GPR under this line of credit is comprised of principal of $1,199,527 and accrued\ninterest of $184,928 at December 31, 2022. The Company entered into an Amendment and Forbearance Agreement with GPR on January 5, 2023\nwherein GPR agreed to: (a) increase the existing LOC from $5,000,000 due March 16, 2025 to $35,000,000 due March 16, 2027, (b) roll two\nexisting promissory notes purchased by GPR into the LOC resulting in the extinguishment of such notes as separate instruments, and (c)\nto forebear until January 12, 2024, on exercising its foreclosure rights under its defaulted Senior Secured Note. The Company’s\nBoard of Directors approved a revision in the conversion price at which the LOC may convert into the Company’s common stock from\n$1.65 per share to $1.05 per share, based upon the market price of the Company’s common stock over the 3 days preceding the agreement.\nGPR is the Company’s majority shareholder and largest debtholder. GPR holds a senior secured interest in all of the assets of the\nCompany, including the stock of its subsidiary entities. During the year ended December\n31, 2021, GPR, a related party, advanced $665,498 in direct payments on the Company’s behalf, to reduce certain accounts payable\nand operating expenses. The balance due GPR under this line of credit is comprised of principal of $985,095 and accrued interest of $85,831\nat December 31, 2021. Included in the foregoing\nyear-end balances was a pre-existing convertible note in default held by a non-affiliate third party with a principal balance of $100,000\nand accrued interest of $71,671, which GPR purchased in September 2021. Going Concern The consolidated financial\nstatements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.\nThe Company has accumulated losses from inception through the period ended December 31, 2022 of $106,530,496, and a working capital deficit\nof $12,350,048, as well as negative cash flows from operating activities. Presently, the Company does not have adequate cash resources\nto meet its debt obligations in the 12 months following the date of this filing. In addition, virtually all of the Company’s assets\nare encumbered or are pledged under senior secured debt that is in default. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s\nability to continue as a going concern. Management is in the process of evaluating various financing alternatives to finance its capital\nrequirements, as well as for general and administrative expenses. These alternatives include raising funds through public or private equity\nmarkets and either through institutional or retail investors. Although there is no assurance that the Company will be successful with\nits fund-raising initiatives, management believes that the Company will be able to secure the necessary financing as a result of ongoing\nfinancing discussions with third party investors and existing shareholders. 12\xa0 The consolidated financial\nstatements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company’s\ncontinuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to obtain additional financing as may be required and ultimately to attain\nprofitability. If the Company raises additional funds through the issuance of equity, the percentage ownership of current shareholders\ncould be reduced, and such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights, preferences and privileges of\nthe Company’s common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not\navailable or are not available on acceptable terms, the Company may not be able to take advantage of prospective business endeavors or\nopportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict its future plans for developing its business and achieving commercial\nrevenues. If the Company is unable to obtain the necessary capital, the Company may have to cease operations.

Net cash provided by operating\nactivities was $1,164 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Investing Activities For the year ended December\n31, 2022, and 2021 the Company conducted no investing activities. Financing Activities The Company’s financing\nduring 2022 was from non-cash advances from a related party totaling $314,433, for expenses of the Company paid by such related party.\nThe Company’s financing during 2021 was from advances from a related party totaling $665,497, which were paid to certain vendors\non the Company’s behalf. 13\xa0 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements \xa0 During the year ended December\n31, 2022, we did not engage in any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303(a)(4) of the SEC’s Regulation S-K. Effects of Inflation \xa0 We do not believe that inflation\nhas had a material impact on our business, revenues or operating results during the periods presented. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates \xa0 Our significant accounting\npolicies are more fully described in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. We believe that the accounting policies below are critical for one to fully understand and\nevaluate our financial condition and results of operations. Impairment of Long-lived Assets We are reviewing the property\nand equipment, intangible assets subject to amortization and other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances\nindicate that the carrying amount of an asset class may not be recoverable. Indicators of potential impairment include: an adverse change\nin legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset; an adverse change in the extent or manner in which\nthe asset is used or is expected to be used, or in its physical condition; and current or forecasted operating or cash flow losses that\ndemonstrate continuing losses associated with the use of the asset. If indicators of impairment are present, the asset is tested for recoverability\nby comparing the carrying value of the asset to the related estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset.\nIf the expected cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, then the asset is considered to be impaired and its carrying\nvalue is written down to fair value, based on the related estimated discounted cash flows. There were no impairment charges in the year\nended December 31, 2022, however, in 2019 we decided to combine the carrying value of our mining and mineral assets as they are inseparable\nand depend upon each other in value creation. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted\nfor based upon an asset and liability approach.\xa0\xa0Accordingly, deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from the difference\nbetween the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the financial statements.\xa0\xa0Deferred tax amounts are\ndetermined using the tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes will actually be paid or refunds received, as provided under currently\nenacted tax law.\xa0\xa0Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to\nbe realized.\xa0\xa0Income tax expense or benefit is the tax payable or refundable, respectively, for the period plus or minus the\nchange in deferred tax assets and liabilities during the period. Accounting guidance requires\nthe recognition of a financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely\nthan not sustain the position following an audit.\xa0\xa0For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount\nrecognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon\nultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority.\xa0\xa0The Company believes its income tax filing positions and deductions will\nbe sustained upon examination and accordingly, no reserves, or related accruals for interest and penalties have been recorded at December\n31, 2022 and 2021. The Company recognizes interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits as well as interest received from favorable\ntax settlements within income tax expense.\xa0 Recent Accounting Standards During the year ended December\n31, 2022 and through April 17, 2023, there were several new accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board.\nEach of these pronouncements, as applicable, has been or will be adopted by the Company. Management does not believe the adoption of any\nof these accounting pronouncements has had or will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 14\xa0 ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY\nDATA The information called for\nby Item 8 is included following the “Index to Financial Statements” on page F-1 contained in this annual report on Form 10-K. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS\nON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls\nand procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed pursuant to the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the\ntime periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and\ncommunicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions\nregarding required disclosures. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,\nassurance the objectives of the control system are met. Under the supervision of,\nand the participation of, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have conducted an evaluation\nof our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended\n(the “Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K to ensure that information required\nto be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within\nthe time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management\nas appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer concluded that the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December\n31, 2022, because of the identification of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described below. Notwithstanding\nthe material weaknesses that existed as of December 31, 2022, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have each concluded\nthat the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K present fairly, in all material respects, the financial\nposition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company and its subsidiaries in conformity with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). We are currently taking steps to remediate such material weaknesses as\ndescribed below. Management’s Report on Internal Control\nover Financial Reporting Our management is responsible\nfor establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a set\nof processes designed by, or under the supervision of, a company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, to provide\nreasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that: \n \n \xa0 \n ● \n Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets; \n \n \n \xa0 \n ● \n Provide reasonable assurance our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and \n \n \n \xa0 \n ● \n Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n 15\xa0 Because of its inherent limitations,\ninternal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. It should be noted that any system of internal control,\nhowever well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system will be\nmet. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and\nwith the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an assessment\nof the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in “Internal Control-Integrated\nFramework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), as of December 31, 2009. As a result of our continued\nmaterial weaknesses described below, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting\nwas not effective based on the criteria in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework” issued by COSO. Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over\nFinancial Reporting A material weakness is a control\ndeficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of annual\nor interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. In connection with the assessment, management identified the following\ncontrol deficiencies, which were previously identified, that still represent material weaknesses at December 31, 2022: \n \n \xa0 \n ● \n The Company, at times in the past prior to the period covered by this annual statement, entered into material transactions without timely obtaining the appropriate signed agreements, stock certificates and board approval prior to releasing cash funds called for by the transaction. Management believes the approval process currently in place is sufficient to alleviate any misappropriation of funds and will change procedures if and when circumstances indicate they are needed. Although the Company has taken steps to prevent this from happening by utilizing an escrow agent, agreements entered into by prior management will continue to cause an issue until such prior agreements terminate or expire. \n \n \n \xa0 \n ● \n Management did not design and maintain effective control relating to the quarter end closing and financial reporting process due to lack of evidence of review surrounding various account reconciliations and properly evidenced journal entries. Due to the Company’s limited resources, the Company has insufficient personnel resources and technical accounting and reporting expertise to properly address all of the accounting matters inherent in the Company’s financial transactions. Additionally, though the Company has recently formed a formal audit committee, the Company has not yet formalized processes and controls that would provide proper board oversight role within the financial reporting process. Management continues to search for additional board members that are independent and can add financial expertise and intends to formalize oversight processes in this area in an effort to remediate part of this material weakness. \n \n \n \xa0 \n ● \n The Company’s change in management, board members and officer positions resulting in changes of the responsible person for certain duties has caused delays in the timely review of financial data and banking information. The Company has very limited review procedures in place. This material weakness, previously identified, continued in 2022 as a result of additional management changes. Management plans to establish a more formal review process by the board members in an effort to reduce the risk of fraud and financial misstatements. \n We are in the process of establishing\ncertain steps in response to the identification of these material weaknesses that should result in certain changes in our internal control\nover financial reporting, but due to the Company’s limited funds and inability to add certain staff personnel, the changes may be\nlimited and may also not be completely effective. There were no additional material weaknesses noted during the year ended December 31,\n2022. ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION None.\xa0 ITEM 9C.

REUTERS/Brian Snyder/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tab Companies BEIJING, May 13 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden is set to announce new China tariffs as soon as Tuesday, targeting sectors including electric vehicles, medical supplies and solar equipment, according to people familiar with the matter. The expected move by the Biden administration comes ahead of the November presidential election. Biden, a Democrat seeking re-election, has taken a tough-on-China approach that would maintain existing tariffs on many Chinese goods set by former President Donald Trump, his expected Republican challenger. Sign up here. The impact on Chinese industries, however, is expected to be limited. DOES CHINA EXPORT EVS TO THE UNITED STATES? Very few. In the first quarter, Geely (GEELY.UL) was the only Chinese automaker to export to the United States with 2,217 cars, according to data from the China Passenger Car Association. Geely, which has sold some EVs in the U.S. market under its Polestar brand, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. China\'s Geely and Sweden\'s Volvo Cars (VOLCARb.ST), opens new tab founded EV maker Polestar Automotive, which makes most of its cars in China. Volvo is majority-owned by Geely. Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath told Reuters last month the company is accelerating efforts to produce more vehicles outside China. Polestar aims for a sales breakdown of 40% in Europe, 30% in the United States and 30% in the Asia-Pacific region, he said. Ingenlath told Reuters last year that Polestar will start production in South Carolina for U.S. and European markets from 2024. ARE NEW TARIFFS A THREAT TO CHINA\'S SOLAR INDUSTRY? The market is small for China and exports to the United States have been subject to tariffs for more than a decade. Further duties were also recently imposed on several Chinese solar panel makers who finished their panels in Southeast Asia. Over 80% of solar panel manufacturing now takes place in China, and the cost of making a panel in China is 60% cheaper than in the U.S., according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. Last year, China exported $3.35 million solar cells to the U.S., less than 0.1% of China\'s total exports. Outbound shipments of completed solar panels to the U.S. stood at $13.15 million in 2023, only 0.03% of China\'s solar panel exports. Industry observers said the equipment to produce solar panels involves a complicated supply chain. How the new U.S. tariffs affect sales of that equipment will depend on the details of the U.S. trade levy, they said. WHAT ABOUT MEDICAL SUPPLIES? Chinese-made medical supplies such as syringes and personal protective equipment also face additional U.S. tariffs, sources familiar with the decision said. According to WTO data, China exported $30.9 billion medical goods to the United States in 2022, accounting for about one fifth of China\'s overall exports of medical goods. The expected tariffs are part of the Biden administration\'s broader strategy to protect the U.S. against supply shortages seen during the pandemic that left hospitals scrambling to find critical equipment, the sources said. In December, the United States Trade Representative announced a further extension of China-related "Section 301" tariff exclusions until May 31. The American Medical Manufacturers Association has called for these exclusions to be revoked, arguing they are no longer needed to deal with a COVID-19 emergency. The association says American manufacturers need the chance to compete with imports on a more level playing field. MORE TARIFFS ON METAL PRODUCTS? Biden in April also called for tripling U.S. tariffs on Chinese metal products. That would apply to more than $1 billion worth of steel and aluminium products, a U.S. official said.

The White House cited "China\'s non-market overcapacity in steel and aluminum, which are among the world\'s most carbon intensive."\n\n\\\\* Semiconductors: Tariffs will increase from 25% to 50% by 2025, the White House said, citing China\'s huge share in new semiconductor wafers coming online and a spike in prices during the pandemic. "China\'s policies in the legacy semiconductor sector have led to growing market share and rapid capacity expansion that risks driving out investment by market-driven firms."\n\n\\\\* Electric Vehicles: Tariffs will increase from 25% to 100% in 2024 (on top of a separate 2.5% tariff), the White House said, citing "extensive subsidies and non-market practices leading to substantial risks of overcapacity." The U.S. Trade Representative\'s Office said plug-in hybrid electric vehicles will be covered by the new tariffs but not hybrid vehicles.\n\n\\\\* Batteries, Battery Components and Parts: Tariffs on lithium-ion EV batteries will increase from 7.5% to 25% in 2024, while the tariff rate on lithium-ion non-EV batteries will increase from 7.5% to 25% in 2026. Tariff rates on battery parts will increase from 7.5% to 25% in 2024\n\n\\\\* Critical minerals: Tariffs for certain critical minerals will increase from 0 to 25% in 2024.\n\nMinerals covered by the new tariffs include: Manganese ores and concentrates including ferruginous manganese ores & concentrates with manganese content over 20% calculated on dry weight; Cobalt ores and concentrates; Aluminum ores and concentrates; Zinc ores and concentrates; Chromium ores and concentrates; Tungsten concentrates, oxides, carbide, powders and Tungstates (wolframates); Tritium and its compounds, alloys, dispersions, ceramic products and mixtures thereof; Actinium, Californium, Curium, Einsteinium, Gadolinium, Polonium, Radium, Uranium & their compounds, alloys, dispersions, ceramic products & mixtures; Other radioactive elements, isotopes, compounds; alloys, dispersions, ceramic products and mixtures; Radioactive residues; Ferronickel; Ferroniobium containing by weight less than 0.02% of phosphorus or sulfur or less than 0.4% of silicon; Zinc (other than alloy), unwrought, containing o/99.99% by weight of zinc; Zinc (o/than alloy); Zinc alloy, unwrought; Tin o/than alloy), unwrought; Tin alloy, unwrought; Tantalum, unwrought; tantalum powders; Chromium, unwrought; chromium powders; Indium, unwrought; indium powders\n\n\\\\* Natural graphite and permanent magnets for EV batteries: Tariffs will increase from 0% to 25% in 2026; tariffs for certain other critical minerals will also increase from 0% to 25% in 2024.\n\n\\\\* Solar cells: Tariffs on cells - whether assembled into modules or not - will double to 50% in 2024 to "protect against China’s policy-driven overcapacity that depresses prices and inhibits the development of solar capacity outside of China."\n\n\\\\* Ship-to-shore cranes: New tariffs of 25% will be added in 2024 to "help protect U.S. manufacturers from China\'s unfair trade practices that have led to excessive concentration in the market."\n\n\\\\* Medical Products Syringes and needles: New tariffs of 50% will be imposed in 2024; tariffs for certain personal protective equipment (PPE), including some respirators and face masks, will increase from the current range of 0 to 7.5% to 25% in 2024. Tariffs on rubber medical and surgical gloves will increase from 7.5% to 25% in 2026 to "help support and sustain a strong domestic industrial base for medical supplies that were essential to the COVID-19 pandemic response."\n\n## PROPOSED EXCLUSIONS\n\nThe U.S. Trade Representative\'s (USTR) office said it has proposed exclusions from the tariffs on over 330 categories of industrial machinery to aid U.S. manufacturers, including producers of solar panels.\n\nThe list, contained in a lengthy USTR review of its Section 301 tariffs, includes 19 categories of equipment used to manufacture solar panels, including silicon crystal growth furnaces, and soldering and lamination machines. USTR said these exclusions will encourage domestic manufacturing of solar products.\n\nOther broad categories for industrial exclusions include:\n\n\\\\* Hydraulic and mechanical metal presses, machine tools for working metal and stone, metal rolling mills.\n\n\\\\* Offshore oil and gas drilling and production platforms, boring and rock cutting machinery.\n\n\\\\* Agricultural equipment including seeders, planters, fertilizer distributors.\n\n\\\\* Brewery and bakery equipment, machinery for preparation of meat and poultry.\n\n\\\\* Textile machinery including spinning and knitting machines, looms and sewing machines.\n\n\\\\* Molding machines for rubber and plastics, industrial furnaces for making printed circuit assemblies.\n\nReporting by David Shepardson and David Lawder; Editing by Heather Timmons, Dan Burns, Sonali Paul and Ros Russell\n\nOur Standards: [The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tab](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html)\n\nShare\n\n- X\n\n- Facebook\n\n- Linkedin\n\n- Email\n\n- Link\n\n\n[Purchase Licensing Rights](https://www.reutersagency.com/en/licensereuterscontent/?utm_medium=rcom-article-media&utm_campaign=rcom-rcp-lead)\n\n## Read Next\n\n- [Technologycategory](https://www.reuters.com/technology/) [Start Campus plans to invest $9.35 billion in Portugal data hub](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/start-campus-plans-invest-935-billion-portugal-data-hub-2025-04-04/) 11:12 AM UTC\n\n- [Climate & Energycategory](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/) [Africa\'s top climate negotiator says \'no reverse gear\' on commitments](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/cop/africas-top-climate-negotiator-says-no-reverse-gear-commitments-2025-04-04/) 9:23 AM UTC\n\n- [Climate & Energycategory](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/) [French onshore wind power project halted by court](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/french-onshore-wind-power-project-halted-by-court-2025-04-04/) 8:51 AM UTC\n\n- [category](https://www.reuters.com/markets/) [Indian delegation to visit Chile seeking stake in SQM\'s lithium projects, source says](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/indian-delegation-visit-chile-seeking-stake-sqms-lithium-projects-source-says-2025-04-04/) 8:02 AM UTC\n\n\n## [World](https://www.reuters.com/world/)\n\n- ### [Hard-right candidate leads field as new Romania election campaign begins](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/hard-right-candidate-leads-field-new-romania-election-campaign-begins-2025-04-04/)\n\n[Europecategory](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/) · April 4, 2025 · 1:24 PM UTC · ago\n\nRomanian presidential candidates began campaigning on Friday for the rerun of an election canceled over accusations of Russian meddling, with Romania\'s role in NATO and the EU and its aid to neighbouring Ukraine in the spotlight.\n\n- [Middle Eastcategory](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/) [Israeli troops expand \'security zone\' in northern Gaza](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-troops-expand-security-zone-northern-gaza-2025-04-04/) 1:22 PM UTC · Updated ago\n\n- [Worldcategory](https://www.reuters.com/world/) [Which countries are quitting a key landmine treaty and why?](https://www.reuters.com/world/which-countries-are-quitting-key-landmine-treaty-why-2025-04-04/) 1:20 PM UTC · Updated ago\n\n- [Worldcategory](https://www.reuters.com/world/) [Sanctioned Russia escapes immediate US tariff hit, braces for long-term impact](https://www.reuters.com/world/kremlin-says-russia-must-guard-against-world-market-turbulence-after-trump-2025-04-04/) 1:18 PM UTC · Updated ago\n\n- [Middle Eastcategory](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/) [Exclusive: Turkey wants no confrontation with Israel in Syria, foreign minister says](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkey-wants-no-confrontation-with-israel-syria-foreign-minister-says-2025-04-04/) 1:17 PM UTC · Updated ago', url='https://www.reuters.com/world/what-are-bidens-new-tariffs-china-goods-2024-05-14/')][0m

Other new KS items included cat food,\ngarlic butter shrimp, barbecue grills and yellow golf balls, each showing significant savings over comparable brand\nname products.\nOur ecommerce business provides a broader selection of merchandise that complements our warehouses. This\nincludes appliances, home furnishings, consumer electronics, lawn and garden, health and beauty aids, apparel,\nand 2-Day Grocery Delivery. Costco Next, a Costco marketplace that offers an additional selection of products,\nhas over 60 suppliers and continues to grow.\nWe are dedicated more than ever to operate in a sustainable manner. Our merchandise teams concentrated on\ndecreasing packaging and plastic use, utilizing post-consumer recycled content, and finding ways to increase sell\nunits on pallets, trucks and containers, which maximizes space and therefore reduces emissions and costs. We\nalso continue to focus on diversity through inclusion, employee development, community involvement and\nsupplier diversity. Embracing differences is important to the growth of our company, as it leads to opportunities,\ninnovation and employee satisfaction.\nThe coming months will see changes at the executive level. After nearly two years as Costco's President and\nCOO, Ron Vachris will transition to the role of CEO, with Craig Jelinek retiring from the CEO role after serving in\nthat capacity for more than twelve years. As has been the case since Ron became President and COO, we expect\na smooth and seamless transition, maintaining the culture and operational excellence that Costco has been\nknown for throughout many years.\nAs this letter was being finalized, we were saddened to learn that Charlie Munger had peacefully passed away,\njust five weeks shy of his hundredth birthday. Charlie was a long-time fan of Costco, serving on our Board for\nmore than 26 years. No one loved Costco more than Charlie and our company benefited greatly from his wisdom,\nhis business acumen, his passion for our business, his strong moral ethos and his common sense. We will miss\nCharlie dearly and will take with us the many fond memories that he bestowed on us, personally, and on our\ncompany.\nWe extend our deepest gratitude and compliments to our more than 316,000 employees. Their exemplary service\nto our members, dedication to maintaining our core values and culture, and support of one another is why our\nemployees are our greatest competitive advantage.\nFinally, we would like to thank Costco members around the world. Thank you for your loyal support and trust in\nCostco. May the year ahead bring you and your families good health, happiness, peace and prosperity.\nSincerely,\nCraig Jelinek Ron Vachris\nChief Executive Officer President & COO\nCanada\nPuerto Rico\nUnited States and\nMéxico\n108\n600\n40\nUNITED\nSTATES\nCOSTCO.COM\nALABAMA –4\nALASKA –4\nARIZONA – 20\nARKANSAS– 1\nCALIFORNIA – 135\nCOLORADO – 16\nCONNECTICUT– 8\nDELAWARE– 1\nFLORIDA – 31\nGEORGIA – 17\nHAWAII – 7\nIDAHO – 7\nILLINOIS– 23\nINDIANA –9\nIOWA –4\nKANSAS– 3\nKENTUCKY –4\nLOUISIANA – 3\nMAINE– 1\nMARYLAND – 11\nMASSACHUSETTS–6\nMICHIGAN – 16\nMINNESOTA – 13\nMISSISSIPPI – 1\nMISSOURI –9\nMONTANA – 5\nNEBRASKA – 3\nNEVADA – 8\nNEWHAMPSHIRE– 1\nNEWJERSEY – 21\nNEWMEXICO – 3\nNEWYORK – 19\nNORTH CAROLINA – 10\nNORTH DAKOTA – 2\nOHIO – 13\nOKLAHOMA –4\nOREGON – 13\nPENNSYLVANIA – 11\nSOUTH CAROLINA –6\nSOUTH DAKOTA – 1\nTENNESSEE– 7\nTEXAS – 38\nUTAH – 14\nVERMONT– 1\nVIRGINIA – 17\nWASHINGTON – 33\nWISCONSIN – 11\nWASHINGTON, D.C. – 1\nPUERTO RICO –4\n871 locations as of December 31, 2023\nCANADA\nCOSTCO.CA\nALBERTA – 19\nBRITISH COLUMBIA – 14\nMANITOBA – 3\nNEWBRUNSWICK – 3\nNEWFOUNDLAND AND\nLABRADOR – 1\nNOVA SCOTIA – 2\nONTARIO –40\nQUÉBEC – 23\nSASKATCHEWAN – 3\nMÉXICO\nCOSTCO.COM.MX\nAGUASCALIENTES – 1\nBAJA CALIFORNIA –4\nBAJA CALIFORNIA SUR – 1\nCHIHUAHUA – 2\nCIUDAD DE MÉXICO – 5\nCOAHUILA – 1\nGUANAJUATO – 3\nJALISCO – 3\nMÉXICO – 5\nMICHOACÁN – 1\nMORELOS– 1\nNUEVO LEÓN – 3\nPUEBLA – 1\nQUERÉTARO – 1\nQUINTANA ROO – 1\nSAN LUISPOTOSÍ – 1\nSINALOA – 1\nSONORA – 1\nTABASCO – 1\nVERACRUZ– 2\nYUCATÁN – 1\nAustralia\nChina\nSpain\nFrance\nIceland\nUnited\nKingdom\n4\n2\n1\n29\n15\nSweden\n1\n5\nNew\nZealand\n1\nTaiwan\nJapan\nKorea\n14\n18\n33\nCOR000296 1623\nAUSTRALIA\nCOSTCO.COM.AU\nAUSTRALIAN CAPITAL\nTERRITORY – 1\nNEWSOUTHWALES –4\nQUEENSLAND – 3\nSOUTH AUSTRALIA – 1\nVICTORIA –4\nWESTERN AUSTRALIA – 2\nNEW ZEALAND\nAUCKLAND – 1\nSHANGHAI – 1\nJAPAN\nCOSTCO.CO.JP\nAICHI – 2\nCHIBA – 3\nFUKUOKA – 2\nGIFU – 1\nGUNMA – 2\nHIROSHIMA – 1\nHOKKAIDO – 2\nHYOGO – 2\nIBARAKI – 2\nISHIKAWA – 1\nKANAGAWA – 3\nKUMAMOTO – 1\nKYOTO – 1\nMIYAGI – 1\nOSAKA – 2\nSAITAMA – 2\nSHIZUOKA – 1\nTOCHIGI - 1\nTOKYO – 1\nTOYAMA – 1\nYAMAGATA – 1\nSWEDEN\nSTOCKHOLM – 1\nKOREA\nCOSTCO.CO.KR\nBUSAN – 1\nCHEONAN – 1\nDAEGU – 2\nDAEJEON – 1\nGIMHAE– 1\nGYEONGGI-DO – 5\nINCHEON – 1\nSEJONG – 1\nSEOUL –4\nULSAN – 1\nCHINA\nSHANGHAI – 2\nJIANGSU – 1\nZHEJIANG – 2\nTAIWAN\nCOSTCO.COM.TW\nCHIAYI CITY – 1\nHSINCHU CITY – 1\nKAOHSIUNGCITY – 2\nNEWTAIPEI CITY – 3\nTAICHUNG CITY – 2\nTAINAN CITY – 1\nTAIPEI CITY – 2\nTAOYUAN CITY – 2\nUNITED\nKINGDOM\nCOSTCO.CO.UK\nENGLAND – 25\nSCOTLAND – 3\nWALES– 1\nICELAND\nKAUPTÚN – 1\nSPAIN\nANDALUCÍA – 1\nBISCAY – 1\nMADRID – 2\nMADRID – 2\nFRANCE\nÎLE-DE-FRANCE– 2\n\nUNITED STATES\nSECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION\nWashington, D.C. 20549\nFORM 10-K\n☒ ANNUAL REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES\nEXCHANGE ACT OF 1934\nFor the fiscal year ended September 3, 2023\nor\n☐ TRANSITION REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES\nEXCHANGE ACT OF 1934\nCommission file number 0-20355\nCostco Wholesale Corporation\n(Exact name of registrant as specified in its charter)\nWashington 91-1223280\n(State or other jurisdiction of\nincorporation or organization)\n(I.R.S.

Forward-looking\nstatements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake to update these\nstatements, except as required by law.\nPART I\nItem 1—Business\nCostco Wholesale Corporation and its subsidiaries (Costco or the Company) began operations in 1983, in\nSeattle, Washington. We are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the\nUnited States (U.S.) and Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico, Japan, the United Kingdom (U.K.), Korea,\nAustralia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Costco operated 861, 838,\nand 815 warehouses worldwide at September 3, 2023, August 28, 2022, and August 29, 2021. The\nCompany operates e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Korea, Taiwan, Japan,\nand Australia. Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, under the symbol\n“COST.”\nWe report ona52/53-week fiscal year, consisting of thirteen four-week periods and ending on the Sunday\nnearest the end of August. The first three quarters consist of three periods each, and the fourth quarter\nconsists of four periods (five weeks in the thirteenth period ina53-week year). The material seasonal\nimpact in our operations is increased net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season.\nReferences to 2023 relate to the 53-week fiscal year ended September 3, 2023. References to 2022 and\n2021 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended August 28, 2022, and August 29, 2021.\nGeneral\nWe operate membership warehouses and e-commerce websites based on the concept that offering our\nmembers low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide\nrange of categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. When combined with\nthe operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of\nmerchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, these volumes and turnover enable us to\noperate profitably at significantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most other\nretailers. We often sell inventory before we are required to pay for it, even while taking advantage of early\npayment discounts.\n4\nWe buy most of our merchandise directly from suppliers and route it to cross-docking consolidation points\n(depots) or directly to our warehouses. Our depots receive large shipments from suppliers and quickly\nship these goods to warehouses. This process creates freight volume and handling efficiencies, lowering\ncosts associated with traditional multiple-step distribution channels. Our e-commerce operations ship\nmerchandise through our depots and logistics operations, as well as through drop-ship and other delivery\narrangements with our suppliers.\nOur average warehouse space is approximately 147,000 square feet, with newer units being slightly\nlarger. Floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space, the handling of\nmerchandise, and the control of inventory. Because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of\nmerchandise and low prices, our warehouses are not elaborate. By strictly controlling the entrances and\nexits and usingamembership format, we believe our inventory losses (shrinkage) are well below those of\ntypical retail operations.\nOur warehouses on average operate onaseven-day, 70-hour week. Gasoline operations generally have\nextended hours. Because the hours of operation are shorter than many other retailers, and due to other\nefficiencies inherent in a warehouse-type operation, labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales.\nMerchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large\nquantities, reducing labor required. In general, with variations by country, our warehouses accept certain\ncredit cards, including Costco co-branded cards, debit cards, cash and checks, Executive member 2%\nreward certificates, co-brand cardholder rebates, and our proprietary stored-value card (shop card).\nOur strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of high-quality merchandise at prices we\nbelieve are consistently lower than elsewhere. We seek to limit most items to fast-selling models, sizes,\nand colors. We carry less than 4,000 active stock keeping units (SKUs) per warehouse in our core\nwarehouse business, significantly less than other broadline retailers. We average anywhere from 9,000 to\n11,000 SKUs online, some of which are also available in our warehouses. Many consumable products are\noffered for sale in case, carton, or multiple-pack quantities only.\nIn keeping with our policy of member satisfaction, we generally accept returns of merchandise. On certain\nelectronic items, we typically have a 90-day return policy and provide, free of charge, technical support\nservices, as well as an extended warranty. Additional third-party warranty coverage is sold on certain\nelectronic items.\nWe offer merchandise and services in the following categories:\nCore Merchandise Categories (or core business):\n• Foods and Sundries (including sundries, dry grocery, candy, cooler, freezer, deli, liquor, and\ntobacco)\n• Non-Foods (including major appliances, electronics, health and beauty aids, hardware, garden\nand patio, sporting goods, tires, toys and seasonal, office supplies, automotive care, postage,\ntickets, apparel, small appliances, furniture, domestics, housewares, special order kiosk, and\njewelry)\n• Fresh Foods (including meat, produce, service deli, and bakery)\nWarehouse Ancillary (includes gasoline, pharmacy, optical, food court, hearing aids, and tire installation)\nand Other Businesses (includes e-commerce1, business centers\n1\n, travel, and other)\nWarehouse ancillary businesses operate primarily within or next to our warehouses, encouraging\nmembers to shop more frequently. The number of warehouses with gas stations varies significantly by\ncountry, and we have no gasoline business in Korea, China, or Sweden. We operated 692 gas stations at\nthe end of 2023. Our gasoline business represented approximately 13% of total net sales in 2023.\n5\n1 E-commerce and business centers are allocated to the appropriate merchandise categories in the Net Sales portion of Item 7.\nOur other businesses sell products and services that complement our warehouse operations (core and\nwarehouse ancillary businesses). Our e-commerce operations give members convenience and a broader\nselection of goods and services. Net sales for e-commerce represented approximately 6% of total net\nsales in 2023. This figure does not include other services we offer online in certain countries such as\nbusiness delivery, travel, same-day grocery, and various other services. Our business centers carry items\ntailored specifically for food services, convenience stores and offices, and offer walk-in shopping and\ndeliveries. Business centers are included in our total warehouse count. Costco Travel offers vacation\npackages, car rentals, cruises, hotels, and other travel products exclusively for Costco members (offered\nin the U.S., Canada, and the U.K.).\nWe have direct buying relationships with many producers of brand-name merchandise. We do not obtain\na significant portion of merchandise from any one supplier. When sources of supply become unavailable,\nwe seek alternatives. We also purchase and manufacture private-label merchandise, as long as quality\nand member demand are high and the value to our members is significant.\nCertain financial information for our segments and geographic areas is included in Note 11 to the\nconsolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nMembership\nOur members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and websites. Gold Star\nmemberships are available to individuals; Business memberships are limited to businesses, including\nindividuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document. Business members may\nadd additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for\nGold Star members. Our annual fee for these memberships is $60 in the U.S. and varies in other\ncountries. All paid memberships include a free household card.\nOur member renewal rate was 92.7% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.4% worldwide at the end of 2023.\nThe majority of members renew within six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which\nexcludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period\nseven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships\nas well as memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.\nOur membership was made up of the following (in thousands):\n2023 2022 2021\nGold Star ................................................ 58,800 54,000 50,200\nBusiness, including affiliates ......... ....................... 12,200 11,800 11,500\nTotal paid members ..................................... 71,000 65,800 61,700\nHousehold cards ......................................... 56,900 53,100 49,900\nTotal cardholders ................ ....................... 127,900 118,900 111,600\nPaid cardholders (except affiliates) are eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an\nadditional annual fee of $60. Executive memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K.,\nJapan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive members earn a 2%\nreward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at\nCostco warehouses. This program offers services that vary by state and country and provide access to\nadditional savings and benefits on various business and consumer services, such as auto and home\ninsurance, the Costco auto purchase program, and check printing. Executive members totaled 32.3\nmillion and represented 45.4% of paid members. The sales penetration of Executive members\nrepresented approximately 72.8% of worldwide net sales in 2023.\n6\nHuman Capital\nOur Code of Ethics requires that we “Take Care of Our Employees,” which is fundamental to the\nobligation to “Take Care of Our Members.” We must also carefully control our selling, general and\nadministrative (SG&A) expenses, so that we can sell high quality goods and services at low prices.\nCompensation and benefits for employees is our largest expense after the cost of merchandise and is\ncarefully monitored.\nEmployee Base\nAt the end of 2023, we employed 316,000 employees worldwide. Approximately 95% are employed in our\nmembership warehouses and distribution channels, and approximately 5% are represented by unions.\nWe also utilize seasonal employees.\nThe total number of employees by segment was:\n2023 2022 2021\nUnited States ............................... 208,000 202,000 192,000\nCanada . . .................................. 51,000 50,000 47,000\nOther International .......................... 57,000 52,000 49,000\nTotal employees ............................ 316,000 304,000 288,000\nGrowth and Engagement\nWe believe that our warehouses are among the most productive in the retail industry, owing largely to the\ncommitment and efficiency of our employees. We seek to provide them not merely with employment but\ncareers. Many attributes of our business contribute to the objective. The more significant include:\ncompetitive compensation and benefits for those working in our membership warehouses and\ndistributions channels; a commitment to promoting from within; and a target ratio of at least 50% of our\nemployee base being full-time employees. These attributes contribute to what we consider, especially for\nthe industry, a high retention rate. In 2023, in the U.S. that rate was approximately 90% for employees\nwho have been with us for at least one year.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nThe commitment to “Take Care of Our Employees” is also the foundation of our approach to promoting\ndiversity, equity and inclusion and creating an inclusive and respectful workplace. We strive for an\nenvironment where all employees feel that they belong, are accepted, included, respected and supported\nbecause of who they are. We demonstrate leadership commitment to equity through consistent\ncommunication, employee development and education, support of diversity and inclusion initiatives within\nthe organization, community involvement, and supplier diversity. Costco continues its efforts to develop\nfuture leaders, including through the supervisor in training programs. In 2023, over 7,800 hourly\nemployees completed the 6-week course.\nWell Being\nCostco strives to provide our employees with competitive wages and excellent benefits. In March 2023,\nwe increased the top of the wage scales by 85 cents per hour in the U.S, Canada and Puerto Rico. In\nSeptember of 2023, we increased the starting wage to at least $18.50 for all entry-level positions in the\nU.S. We have also expanded our benefits in the U.S. to include additional mental health support for\nchildren and adults at little to no cost to our employees. Costco is firmly committed to protecting the health\nand safety of our members and employees and to serving our communities.\n7\nFor more detailed information regarding our programs and initiatives, see “Employees” within our\nSustainability Commitment (located on our website). The Sustainability Commitment and other\ninformation on our website are not incorporated by reference into and do not form any part of this Annual\nReport.\nCompetition\nOur industry is highly competitive, based on factors such as price, merchandise quality and selection,\nlocation, convenience, distribution strategy, and customer service. We compete onaworldwide basis with\nglobal, national, and regional wholesalers and retailers, including supermarkets, supercenters, online\nretailers, gasoline stations, hard discounters, department and specialty stores, and operators selling a\nsingle category or narrow range of merchandise. Walmart, Target, Kroger, and Amazon are among our\nsignificant general merchandise retail competitors in the U.S. We also compete with other warehouse\nclubs, including Walmart’s Sam’s Club and BJ’s Wholesale Club in the U.S. Many of the major\nmetropolitan areas in the U.S. and certain of our Other International locations have multiple competing\nclubs.\nIntellectual Property\nWe believe that, to varying degrees, our trademarks, trade names, copyrights, proprietary processes,\ntrade secrets, trade dress, domain names and similar intellectual property add significant value to our\nbusiness and are important to our success. We have invested significantly in the development and\nprotection of our well-recognized brands, including the Costco Wholesale trademarks and our private\x02label brand, Kirkland Signature. We believe that Kirkland Signature products are high quality, offered at\nprices that are generally lower than national brands, and help lower costs, differentiate our merchandise\nofferings, and generally earn higher margins. We expect to continue to increase the sales penetration of\nour private-label items.\nWe rely on trademark and copyright laws, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality, license and other\nagreements with our suppliers, employees and others to protect our intellectual property. The availability\nand duration of trademark registrations vary by country; however, trademarks are generally valid and may\nbe renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and registrations are maintained.\nAvailable Information\nOur U.S. website is www.costco.com.

We could also be affected by additional risks that apply to all companies operating\nin the U.S. and globally, as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently\nconsider to be immaterial. These Risk Factors should be carefully reviewed in conjunction with\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 and\nour consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8 of this Report.\n9\nBusiness and Operating Risks\nWe are highly dependent on the financial performance of our U.S. and Canadian operations.\nOur financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our U.S. and Canadian operations,\nwhich comprised 87% and 84% of net sales and operating income in 2023. Within the U.S., we are highly\ndependent on our California operations, which comprised 27% of U.S. net sales in 2023. Our California\nmarket, in general, has a larger percentage of higher volume warehouses as compared to our other\ndomestic markets. Any substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations could materially\nadversely affect our business and financial results. Declines in financial performance of our U.S.\noperations, particularly in California, and our Canadian operations could arise from, among other things:\nslow growth or declines in comparable warehouse sales (comparable sales); negative trends in operating\nexpenses, including increased labor, healthcare and energy costs; failing to meet targets for warehouse\nopenings; cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses; shifts in sales mix toward lower gross\nmargin products; changes or uncertainties in economic conditions in our markets, including higher levels\nof unemployment and depressed home values; and failing to consistently provide high quality and\ninnovative new products.\nWe may be unsuccessful implementing our growth strategy, including expanding our business in\nexisting markets and new markets, and integrating acquisitions, which could have an adverse\nimpact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur growth is dependent, in part, on our ability to acquire property and build or lease new warehouses\nand depots. We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations. Local land use and\nother regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehouses and depots, as well as local\ncommunity actions opposed to the location of our warehouses or depots at specific sites and the adoption\nof local laws restricting our operations and environmental regulations, may impact our ability to find\nsuitable locations and increase the cost of sites and of constructing, leasing and operating warehouses\nand depots. We also may have difficulty negotiating leases or purchase agreements on acceptable terms.\nIn addition, certain jurisdictions have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or\nrestrict the operation or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs, including us.\nFailure to effectively manage these and other similar factors may affect our ability to timely build or lease\nand operate new warehouses and depots, which could have a material adverse effect on our future\ngrowth and profitability.\nWe seek to expand in existing markets to attain a greater overall market share. A new warehouse may\ndraw members away from our existing warehouses and adversely affect their comparable sales\nperformance, member traffic, and profitability.\nWe intend to continue to open warehouses in new markets. Associated risks include difficulties in\nattracting members due to a lack of familiarity with us, attracting members of other wholesale club\noperators, our lesser familiarity with local member preferences, and seasonal differences in the market.\nEntry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors\nwithalarge, established market presence. We cannot ensure that new warehouses and new e-commerce\nwebsites will be profitable and future profitability could be delayed or otherwise materially adversely\naffected.\nWe have made and may continue to make investments and acquisitions to improve the speed, accuracy\nand efficiency of our supply chains and delivery channels. The effectiveness of these investments can be\nless predictable than opening new locations and might not provide the anticipated benefits or desired\nrates of return.\n10\nOur failure to maintain membership growth, loyalty and brand recognition could adversely affect\nour results of operations.\nMembership loyalty and growth are essential to our business. The extent to which we achieve growth in\nour membership base, increase the penetration of Executive membership, and sustain high renewal rates\nmaterially influences our profitability. Damage to our brands or reputation may negatively impact\ncomparable sales, diminish member trust, and reduce renewal rates and, accordingly, net sales and\nmembership fee revenue, negatively impacting our results of operations.\nWe sell many products under our Kirkland Signature brand. Maintaining consistent product quality,\ncompetitive pricing, and availability of these products is essential to developing and maintaining member\nloyalty. These products also generally carry higher margins than national brand products and represent a\ngrowing portion of our overall sales. If the Kirkland Signature brand experiences a loss of member\nacceptance or confidence, our sales and gross margin results could be adversely affected.\nDisruptions in merchandise distribution or processing, packaging, manufacturing, and other\nfacilities could adversely affect sales and member satisfaction.\nWe depend on the orderly operation of the merchandise receiving and distribution process, primarily\nthrough our depots. We also rely upon processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to\nsupport our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items. Although we believe\nthat our operations are efficient, disruptions due to fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, pandemics\nor other extreme weather conditions or catastrophic events, labor issues or other shipping problems may\nresult in delays in the production and delivery of merchandise to our warehouses, which could adversely\naffect sales and the satisfaction of our members. Our e-commerce operations depend heavily on third\x02party and in-house logistics providers and is negatively affected when these providers are unable to\nprovide services in a timely fashion.\nWe may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends, which could negatively\naffect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services, and our\nmarket share.\nIt is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services that our members will\ndesire. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to identify and respond to trends in demographics and\nconsumer preferences. Failure to identify timely or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes,\npreferences (including those relating to environmental, social and governance practices) and spending\npatterns could negatively affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and\nservices, and our market share. If we are not successful at predicting our sales trends and adjusting our\npurchases accordingly, we may have excess inventory, which could result in additional markdowns, or we\nmay experience out-of-stock positions and delivery delays, which could result in higher costs, both of\nwhich would reduce our operating performance. This could have an adverse effect on net sales, gross\nmargin and operating income.\nAvailability and performance of our information technology (IT) systems are vital to our business.\nFailure to successfully execute IT projects and have IT systems available to our business would\nadversely impact our operations.\nIT systems play a crucial role in conducting our business. These systems are utilized to process a very\nhigh volume of transactions, conduct payment transactions, track and value our inventory and produce\nreports critical for making business decisions. Failure or disruption of these systems could have an\nadverse impact on our ability to buy products and services from our suppliers, produce goods in our\nmanufacturing plants, move the products in an efficient manner to our warehouses and sell products to\nour members. We are undertaking large technology and IT transformation projects. The failure of these\nprojects could adversely impact our business plans and potentially impair our day to day business\noperations. Given the high volume of transactions we process, it is important that we build strong digital\nresiliency to prevent disruption from events such as power outages, computer and telecommunications\n11\nfailures, viruses, internal or external security breaches, errors by employees, and catastrophic events\nsuch as fires, earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes. Any debilitating failure of our critical IT systems,\ndata centers and backup systems would require significant investments in resources to restore IT\nservices and may cause serious impairment in our business operations including loss of business\nservices, increased cost of moving merchandise and failure to provide service to our members. We are\ncurrently making substantial investments in maintaining and enhancing our digital resiliency and failure or\ndelay in these projects could be costly and harmful to our business. Failure to deliver IT transformation\nefforts efficiently and effectively could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact\nour financial condition and results of operations. Insufficient IT capacity could also impact our capacity for\ntimely, complete and accurate financial and non-financial reporting required by law.\nWe are required to maintain the privacy and security of personal and business information amidst\nmultiplying threat landscapes and in compliance with privacy and data protection regulations\nglobally. Failure to do so could damage our business, including our reputation with members,\nsuppliers and employees, cause us to incur substantial additional costs, and become subject to\nlitigation and regulatory action.\nIncreased security threats and more sophisticated cyber misconduct posearisk to our systems,\nnetworks, products and services. We rely upon IT systems and networks, some of which are managed by\nor belong to third parties, including suppliers, partners, vendors, and service providers. Additionally, we\ncollect, store and process sensitive information relating to our business, members, employees, and other\nthird parties. Operating these IT systems and networks, and processing and maintaining this data, in a\nsecure manner, is critical to our business operations and strategy. Increased remote work has also\nincreased the possible attack surfaces. Attempts to gain unauthorized access to systems, networks and\ndata, both ours and third parties with whom we work, are increasing in frequency and sophistication, and\nin some cases, these attempts are successful. Cybersecurity attacks may range from random attempts to\ncoordinated and targeted attacks, including sophisticated computer crimes and advanced persistent\nthreats. Phishing attacks have emerged as particularly prominent, including as vectors for ransomware\nattacks, which have increased in breadth and frequency. While we train our employees as part of our\nsecurity efforts, that training cannot be completely effective. These threats posearisk to the security of\nour systems and networks and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data. Our IT systems\nand networks, or those managed by third parties such as cloud providers or suppliers that otherwise host\nor have access to confidential information, periodically have vulnerabilities, which may go unnoticed for a\nperiod of time. Our logging capabilities, or the logging capabilities of third parties, are also not always\ncomplete or sufficiently detailed, affecting our ability to fully investigate and understand the scope of\nsecurity events. While our cybersecurity and compliance efforts seek to mitigate such risks, there can be\nno guarantee that the actions and controls we and our third-party service providers have implemented\nand are implementing, will be sufficient to protect our systems, information or other property.\nThe potential impacts of a cybersecurity attack include reputational damage, litigation, government\nenforcement actions, penalties, disruption to systems and operations, unauthorized release of confidential\nor otherwise protected information, corruption of data, diminution in the value of our investment in IT\nsystems and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs. This could adversely affect our\ncompetitiveness, results of operations and financial condition and, critically in light of our business model,\nloss of member confidence. Further, the insurance coverage we maintain and indemnification\narrangements with third parties may be inadequate to cover claims, costs, and liabilities relating to\ncybersecurity incidents. In addition, data we collect, store and process is subject toavariety of U.S. and\ninternational laws and regulations, such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation,\nCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and other privacy\nand cybersecurity laws across the various states and around the globe, which may carry significant\npotential penalties for noncompliance.\n12\nWe are subject to payment-related risks.\nWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including select credit and debit cards, cash and checks,\nco-brand cardholder rebates, Executive member 2% reward certificates, and our shop card. As we offer\nnew payment options to our members, we may be subject to additional rules, regulations, compliance\nrequirements, and higher fraud losses. For certain payment methods, we pay interchange and other\nrelated acceptance fees, along with additional transaction processing fees. We rely on third parties to\nprovide payment transaction processing services for credit and debit cards and our shop card. It could\ndisrupt our business if these parties become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We are\nalso subject to fee increases by these service providers.\nWe must comply with evolving payment card association and network operating rules, including data\nsecurity rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers. For example, we\nare subject to Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, which contain compliance guidelines and\nstandards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage, processing and\ntransmission of individual cardholder data. If our internal systems are breached or compromised, we may\nbe liable for card re-issuance costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to\naccept card payments from our members, and our business and operating results could be adversely\naffected. Our failure to offer payment methods desired by our members could createacompetitive\ndisadvantage.\nWe might sell products that cause illness or injury to our members, harm to our reputation, and\nexpose us to litigation.\nIf our merchandise, including food and prepared food products for human consumption, drugs, children's\nproducts, pet products and durable goods, do not meet or are perceived not to meet applicable safety or\nlabeling standards or our members' expectations, we could experience lost sales, increased costs,\nlitigation or reputational harm. The sale of these items involves the risk of illness or injury to our members.\nSuch illnesses or injuries could result from tampering by unauthorized third parties, product contamination\nor spoilage, including the presence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, other agents, or residues\nintroduced during the growing, manufacturing, storage, handling and transportation phases, or faulty\ndesign. Our suppliers are generally contractually required to comply with product safety laws, and we are\ndependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with safety and other standards. While we\nare subject to governmental inspection and regulations and work to comply in all material respects with\napplicable laws and regulations, we cannot be sure that consumption or use of our products will not cause\nillness or injury or that we will not be subject to claims, lawsuits, or government investigations relating to\nsuch matters, resulting in costly product recalls and other liabilities that could adversely affect our\nbusiness and results of operations. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued,\nnegative publicity could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential members and our\ncorporate and brand image, and these effects could be long-term.\nIf we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant omnichannel experience for our\nmembers, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nOmnichannel retailing is rapidly evolving, and we must keep pace with changing member expectations\nand new developments by our competitors. Our members are increasingly using mobile phones, tablets,\ncomputers, and other devices to shop and to interact with us through social media. We are making\ninvestments in our websites and mobile applications. If we are unable to make, improve, or develop\nrelevant member-facing technology in a timely manner, our ability to compete and our results of\noperations could be adversely affected.\nInability to attract, train and retain highly qualified employees could adversely impact our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends on the continued contributions of our employees, including members of our senior\nmanagement and other key operations, IT, merchandising and administrative personnel. Failure to identify\n13\nand implement a succession plan for senior management could negatively impact our business. We must\nattract, train and retain a large and growing number of qualified employees, while controlling related labor\ncosts and maintaining our core values. Our ability to control labor and benefit costs is subject to\nnumerous internal and external factors, including regulatory changes, prevailing wage rates, union\nrelations and healthcare and other insurance costs. We compete with other retail and non-retail\nbusinesses for these employees and invest significant resources in training and motivating them. There is\nno assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future, which could\nhaveamaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may incur property, casualty or other losses not covered by our insurance.\nClaims for employee health care benefits, workers’ compensation, general liability, property damage,\ndirectors’ and officers’ liability, vehicle liability, inventory loss, and other exposures are funded\npredominantly through self-insurance. Insurance coverage is maintained for certain risks to limit\nexposures arising from very large losses. The types and amounts of insurance may vary from time to time\nbased on our decisions with respect to risk retention and regulatory requirements. Significant claims or\nevents, regulatory changes, a substantial rise in costs of health care or costs to maintain our insurance or\nthe failure to maintain adequate insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on our financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nAlthough we maintain specific coverages for catastrophic property losses, we still bear a significant\nportion of the risk of losses incurred as a result of any physical damage to, or the destruction of, any\nwarehouses, depots, manufacturing or home office facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory, and business\ninterruption. Such losses could materially impact our cash flows and results of operations.\nMarket and Other External Risks\nWe face strong competition from other retailers and warehouse club operators, which could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe retail business is highly competitive. We compete for members, employees, sites, products and\nservices and in other important respects with a wide range of local, regional and national wholesalers and\nretailers, both in the United States and in foreign countries, including other warehouse-club operators,\nsupermarkets, supercenters, online retailers, gasoline stations, hard discounters, department and\nspecialty stores and operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise. Such retailers\nand warehouse club operators compete vigorously and in a variety of ways, including pricing, selection\nand availability, services, location, convenience, store hours, and the attractiveness and ease of use of\nwebsites and mobile applications. The evolution of retailing in online and mobile channels has improved\nthe ability of customers to comparison shop, which has enhanced competition. Some competitors have\ngreater financial resources and technology capabilities, better access to merchandise, and greater market\npenetration than we do. Our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures, changes in the retail\nmarkets or customer expectations could result in lost market share and negatively affect our financial\nresults.\nGeneral economic factors, domestically and internationally, may adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nHigher energy and gasoline costs, inflation, levels of unemployment, healthcare costs, consumer debt\nlevels, foreign-currency exchange rates, unsettled financial markets, weaknesses in housing and real\nestate markets, reduced consumer confidence, changes and uncertainties related to government fiscal,\nmonetary and tax policies including changes in interest rates, tax rates, duties, tariffs, or other restrictions,\nsovereign debt crises, pandemics and other health crises, and other economic factors could adversely\naffect demand for our products and services, require a change in product mix, or impact the cost of or\nability to purchase inventory. Additionally, trade-related actions in various countries, particularly China and\nthe United States, have affected the costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is\ndependent on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. The impact\n14\nto our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in\nresponse to potential cost increases. Higher tariffs could adversely impact our results.\nPrices of certain commodities, including gasoline and consumable goods used in manufacturing and our\nwarehouse retail operations, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in\ndomestic and international supply and demand, inflationary pressures, labor costs, competition, market\nspeculation, government regulations, taxes and periodic delays in delivery. Rapid and significant changes\nin commodity prices and our ability and desire to pass them through to our members may affect our sales\nand profit margins. These factors could also increase our merchandise costs and selling, general and\nadministrative expenses, and otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial results. General\neconomic conditions can also be affected by events like the outbreak of hostilities, including but not\nlimited to the Ukraine conflict, or acts of terrorism.\nInflationary factors such as increases in merchandise costs may adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations. We may not be able to adjust prices to sufficiently offset the effect of\ncost increases without negatively impacting consumer demand.\nSuppliers may be unable to timely supply us with quality merchandise at competitive prices or\nmay fail to adhere to our high standards, resulting in adverse effects on our business,\nmerchandise inventories, sales, and profit margins.\nWe depend heavily on our ability to purchase quality merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive\nprices. As the quantities we require continue to grow, we have no assurances of continued supply,\nappropriate pricing or access to new products, and any supplier has the ability to change the terms upon\nwhich they sell to us or discontinue selling to us. Member demands may lead to out-of-stock positions\ncausingaloss of sales and profits.\nWe buy from numerous domestic and foreign suppliers and importers. Our inability to acquire suitable\nmerchandise on acceptable terms or the loss of key suppliers could negatively affect us. We may not be\nable to develop relationships with new suppliers, and products from alternative sources, if any, may be of\na lesser quality or more expensive. Because of our efforts to adhere to high-quality standards for which\navailable supply may be limited, particularly for certain food items, the large volumes we demand may not\nbe consistently available. Our efforts to secure supply could lead to commitments that prove to be\nunsuccessful in the short and long-term.\nOur suppliers (and those they depend upon for materials and services) are subject to risks, including\nlabor disputes, union organizing activities, financial liquidity, natural disasters, extreme weather\nconditions, public health emergencies, supply constraints and general economic and political conditions\nand other risks similar to those we face that could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable\nmerchandise. One or more of our suppliers might not adhere to our quality control, packaging, legal,\nregulatory, labor, environmental or animal welfare standards. These deficiencies may delay or preclude\ndelivery of merchandise to us and might not be identified before we sell such merchandise to our\nmembers. This failure could lead to recalls and litigation and otherwise damage our reputation and our\nbrands, increase costs, and otherwise adversely impact our business.\nFluctuations in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations.\nDuring 2023, our international operations, including Canada, generated 27% and 34% of our net sales\nand operating income. Our international operations have accounted for an increasing portion of our\nwarehouses, and we plan to continue international growth. To prepare our consolidated financial\nstatements, we translate the financial statements of our international operations from local currencies into\nU.S. dollars using current exchange rates. Future fluctuations in exchange rates that are unfavorable to\nus may adversely affect the financial performance of our Canadian and Other International operations and\nhaveacorresponding adverse period-over-period effect on our results of operations. As we continue to\nexpand internationally, our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may increase.\n15\nA portion of the products we purchase is paid for in a currency other than the local currency of the country\nin which the goods are sold. Currency fluctuations may increase our merchandise costs and may not be\npassed on to members and thus may adversely affect our results of operations.\nNatural disasters, extreme weather conditions, or other catastrophic events could negatively\naffect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nNatural disasters and extreme weather conditions, including those impacted by climate change, such as\nhurricanes, typhoons, floods, earthquakes, wildfires, droughts; acts of terrorism or violence, including\nactive shooter situations; and energy shortages; particularly in California or Washington state, where our\ncentralized operating systems and administrative personnel are located, could negatively affect our\noperations and financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to our properties,\nlimitations on store operating hours, less frequent visits by members to physical locations, the temporary\nclosure of warehouses, depots, manufacturing or home office facilities, the temporary lack of an adequate\nwork force, disruptions to our IT systems, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products\nfrom some local or overseas suppliers, the temporary disruption in the transport of goods to or from\noverseas, delays in the delivery of goods to our warehouses or depots, and the temporary reduction in the\navailability of products in our warehouses. These events could also reduce demand for our products or\nmake it difficult or impossible to procure products. We may be required to suspend operations in some or\nall of our locations, which could haveamaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nPandemics and other health crises, including COVID-19, could affect our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations in many respects.\nThe emergence, severity, magnitude and duration of global or regional health crises are uncertain and\ndifficult to predict. A pandemic, such as COVID-19, could affect certain business operations, demand for\nour products and services, in-stock positions, costs of doing business, availability of labor, access to\ninventory, supply chain operations, our ability to predict future performance, exposure to litigation, and our\nfinancial performance, among other things. Other factors and uncertainties include, but are not limited to:\n• The severity and duration of pandemics;\n• Evolving macroeconomic factors, including general economic uncertainty, unemployment rates,\nand recessionary pressures;\n• Changes in labor markets affecting us and our suppliers;\n• Unknown consequences on our business performance and initiatives stemming from the\nsubstantial investment of time and other resources to the pandemic response;\n• The pace of post-pandemic recovery;\n• The long-term impact of the pandemic on our business, including consumer behaviors; and\n• Disruption and volatility within the financial and credit markets.\nFactors associated with climate change could adversely affect our business.\nWe use natural gas, diesel fuel, gasoline, and electricity in our distribution and warehouse operations.\nGovernment regulations limiting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions and other\nenvironmental restrictions may increase compliance and merchandise costs, and other regulation\naffecting energy inputs could materially affect our profitability. As the economy transitions to lower carbon\nintensity we cannot guarantee that we will make adequate investments or successfully implement\nstrategies that will effectively achieve our climate-related goals, which could lead to negative perceptions\namong members and other stakeholders and result in reputational harm. Climate change, extreme\nweather conditions, wildfires, droughts and rising sea levels could affect our ability to procure\ncommodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience.\nWe also sell a substantial amount of gasoline, the demand for which could be impacted by concerns\nabout climate change and increased regulations. More stringent fuel economy standards, changing public\npolicies aimed at increasing the adoption of zero-emission and alternative fuel vehicles and other\n16\nregulations related to climate change, and evolving consumer preferences will affect our future operations\nand will adversely impact certain elements of our profitability and require significant capital expenditures.\nFailure to meet financial market expectations could adversely affect the market price and volatility\nof our stock.\nWe believe that the price of our stock currently reflects high market expectations for our future operating\nresults. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations, including our warehouse and e\x02commerce comparable sales growth rates, membership renewal rates, new member sign-ups, gross\nmargin, earnings, earnings per share, new warehouse openings, or dividend or stock repurchase policies\ncould cause the price of our stock to decline.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nWe are subject to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political\nand economic factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAt the end of 2023, we operated 270 warehouses outside of the U.S. (31% of all warehouse locations),\nand we plan to continue expanding our international operations. Future operating results internationally\ncould be negatively affected by a variety of factors, many similar to those we face in the U.S., certain of\nwhich are beyond our control. These factors include political and economic conditions, regulatory\nconstraints, currency regulations, policy changes, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in\nwhich we operate, now or in the future. Other factors that may impact international operations include\nforeign trade (including tariffs and trade sanctions), monetary and fiscal policies and the laws and\nregulations of the U.S. and foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated\nwith having major facilities in locations which have been historically less stable than the U.S. Risks\ninherent in international operations also include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing\ninternational operations, adverse tax consequences, and difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights.\nNew reporting obligations globally are increasing the cost and complexity of doing business.\nChanges in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by\nmanagement related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nAccounting principles and related pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations we\napply to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, including self-insurance liabilities, are\nhighly complex and involve subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by our management.\nChanges in rules or interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by our\nmanagement could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance and have a\nmaterial impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nWe are exposed to risks relating to evaluations of controls required by Section 404 of the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act and otherwise.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires management assessments of the effectiveness\nof internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. If we are unable to\nmaintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures, our ability\nto record, process and report financial information accurately and to prepare financial statements within\nrequired time periods could be adversely affected, which could subject us to litigation or investigations\nrequiring management resources and payment of legal and other expenses, negatively affect investor\nconfidence in our financial statements and adversely impact our stock price. Uncertainties around our\ndeveloping systems concerning controls for non-financial reporting also create risks.\n17\nChanges in tax rates, new U.S. or foreign tax legislation, and exposure to additional tax liabilities\ncould adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection and remittance obligations in the U.S. and\nnumerous foreign jurisdictions. Additionally, at any point in time, we may be under examination for value\nadded, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes. We may recognize additional tax\nexpense, be subject to additional tax liabilities, or incur losses and penalties, due to changes in laws,\nregulations, administrative practices, principles, assessments by authorities and interpretations related to\ntax, including tax rules in various jurisdictions. We compute our income tax provision based on enacted\ntax rates in the countries in which we operate. As tax rates vary among countries, a change in earnings\nattributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our\noverall tax provision. Additionally, changes in the enacted tax rates or adverse outcomes in tax audits,\nincluding transfer pricing disputes, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nChanges in or failure to comply with regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and\ndisposal of hazardous materials, hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and other environmental\nmatters (such as recycling and extended producer responsibility requirements) could adversely\nimpact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject toawide and increasingly broad array of federal, state, regional, local and international\nlaws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials,\nhazardous and non-hazardous wastes and other environmental matters. Failure to comply with these\nlaws could result in harm to our members, employees or others, significant costs to satisfy environmental\ncompliance, remediation or compensatory requirements, or the imposition of severe penalties or\nrestrictions on operations by governmental agencies or courts that could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nOperations at our facilities require the treatment and disposal of wastewater, stormwater and agricultural\nand food processing wastes, the use and maintenance of refrigeration systems, including ammonia-based\nchillers, noise, odor and dust management, the operation of mechanized processing equipment, and\nother operations that potentially could affect the environment and public health and safety. Failure to\ncomply with current and future environmental, health and safety standards could result in the imposition of\nfines and penalties, illness or injury of our employees, and claims or lawsuits related to such illnesses or\ninjuries, and temporary closures or limits on the operations of facilities.\nWe are involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits and some of these outcomes could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business requires compliance with many laws and regulations. Failure to achieve compliance could\nsubject us to lawsuits and other proceedings and lead to damage awards, fines, penalties, and\nremediation costs. We are or may become involved inanumber of legal proceedings and audits,\nincluding grand jury investigations, government and agency investigations, and consumer, employment,\ntort, unclaimed property laws, and other litigation. We cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these\nproceedings and other contingencies, including environmental remediation and other proceedings\ncommenced by governmental authorities. The outcome of some of these proceedings, audits, unclaimed\nproperty laws, and other contingencies could require us to take, or refrain from taking, actions which could\nnegatively affect our operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money, adversely\naffecting our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, defending against these lawsuits\nand proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management's attention and\nresources.\nItem 1B—Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\n18\nItem 2—Properties\nWarehouse Properties\nAt September 3, 2023, we operated 861 membership warehouses:\nOwn Land and Building Lease Land and/or Building\n(1)\nTotal\nUnited States and Puerto Rico ............... 477 114 591\nCanada . . ................................. 90 17 107\nOther International ......................... 110 53 163\nTotal .............. . . .......... ........ 677 184 861\n_______________\n(1) 132 of the 184 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.\nAt the end of 2023, our warehouses contained approximately 126.3 million square feet of operating floor\nspace: 87.6 million in the U.S.; 15.3 million in Canada; and 23.4 million in Other International.

MD&A\nis provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial\nstatements and the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). This\nsection generally discusses the results of operations for 2023 compared to 2022. For discussion related\nto the results of operations and changes in financial condition for 2022 compared to 2021 refer to Part II,\nItem 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our\nfiscal year 2022 Form 10-K, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission\n(SEC) on October 5, 2022.\nOverview\nWe believe that the most important driver of our profitability is increasing net sales, particularly\ncomparable sales. Net sales includes our core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, non-foods,\nand fresh foods), warehouse ancillary (gasoline, pharmacy, optical, food court, hearing aids, and tire\ninstallation) and other businesses (e-commerce, business centers, travel and other). Comparable sales is\ndefined as net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and\nexpansions, and sales related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year. The measure is\nintended as supplemental information and is not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with\nU.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). Comparable sales growth is achieved\nthrough increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount they spend on\neach visit (average ticket). Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that\nare beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to our international\noperations); inflation or deflation and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive\nconditions. The higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage our\nSG&A expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. Generating\ncomparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right\nmerchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long\x02term. Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do\nbusiness, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States. Net sales growth and\ngross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and widespread, across a wide\nrange of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce\noperations. While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in\ncompetition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these\nchanges, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the\npenetration of our private-label items, and through online offerings.\nOur philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices. We do\nnot focus in the short-term on maximizing prices charged, but instead seek to maintain what we believe is\na perception among our members of our “pricing authority” – consistently providing the most competitive\nvalues. Merchandise costs in 2023 continued to be impacted by inflation, however at a lower rate than\nwhat we experienced in 2022. The impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our\nmerchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases. Those strategies can include, but are\nnot limited to, working with our suppliers to share in absorbing cost increases, earlier-than-usual\npurchasing and in greater volumes, as well as passing cost increases on to our members. Our\ninvestments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet\ncompetition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our\nmembers, all negatively impacting gross margin and gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross\nmargin percentage).\n21\nWe believe our gasoline business enhances traffic in our warehouses, but it generally has a lower gross\nmargin percentage and lower SG&A expense, relative to our non-gasoline businesses. A higher\npenetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage. Rapidly changing gasoline\nprices may significantly impact our near-term net sales growth. Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit\nnet sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but\ndecreases our SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales. A decline in gasoline prices has the inverse\neffect.\nGovernment actions in various countries relating to tariffs, particularly China and the United States, have\naffected the costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among\nother things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. Higher tariffs could adversely\nimpact our results.\nWe also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows, available\nand desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively\nless substantial component of growth. The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower\ninitial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing\nwarehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they\nrelate to the results of our total operations. Our rate of square footage growth is generally higher in foreign\nmarkets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. Our e-commerce\nbusiness, domestically and internationally, generally has a lower gross margin percentage than our\nwarehouse operations.\nThe membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability.\nThis format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to\nwhich we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of our Executive members,\nand sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Our paid-membership growth rate\nmay be adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new\nmarkets.\nOur financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs. While we believe that we have achieved\nsuccesses in this area, some significant costs are partially outside our control, particularly health care and\nutility expenses. With respect to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to\nminimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of\nreducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation\nlevels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce. This may cause us, for\nexample, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Because\nour business operates on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the consolidated\nstatements of income, particularly merchandise costs and SG&A expenses, can have substantial impacts\non net income.\nOur operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canadian, and Other International operating\nsegments (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report). Certain\noperations in the Other International segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth, lower\nwage and benefit costs as a percentage of sales, less or no direct membership warehouse competition, or\nlack e-commerce or business delivery.\nIn discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign\ncurrencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to\nconvert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars. This\nimpact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current and\nprior period's currency exchange rates. The impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is\ncalculated based on the difference between the current and prior period's average price per gallon sold.\nResults expressed excluding the impacts of foreign exchange and gasoline prices should be reviewed in\nconjunction with results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n22\nOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to 2023 relate to the 53-week fiscal\nyear ended September 3, 2023. References to 2022 and 2021 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended\nAugust 28, 2022, and August 29, 2021. Certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results\nprior to rounding. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to\nCostco.\nHighlights for 2023 versus 2022 include:\n• We opened 26 new warehouses, including three relocations: 13 net new in the U.S. and 10 new in\nour Other International segment. We opened the same number of new warehouses, including\nrelocations, in 2022;\n• Net sales increased 7% to $237,710, driven by a 3% increase in comparable sales, sales at new\nwarehouses opened in 2022 and 2023, and the benefit of one additional week of sales in 2023;\n• Membership fee revenue increased 8% to $4,580, driven by new member sign-ups, upgrades to\nExecutive membership, and one additional week of membership fees in 2023;\n• Gross margin percentage increased nine basis points, driven primarily by a smaller LIFO charge in\n2023 compared to 2022 and our core merchandise categories. This was partially offset by charges of\n$391, predominantly related to the discontinuation of our charter shipping activities;\n• SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 20 basis points, due to increased costs in\nwarehouse operations and other businesses, primarily wage increases effective in March and July\n2022, and March 2023, as well as lower sales growth;\n• The effective tax rate in 2023 was 25.9%, compared to 24.6% in 2022;\n• Net income increased 8% to $6,292, or $14.16 per diluted share compared to $5,844, or $13.14 per\ndiluted share in 2022;\n• In January 2023, the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program in the amount\nof $4,000; and\n• In April 2023, the Board of Directors approved a 13% increase in the quarterly cash dividend.\n23\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Sales\n2023 2022 2021\nNet Sales .......................... ...................... $ 237,710 $ 222,730 $ 192,052\nChanges in net sales:\nU.S. ........................... ...................... 7 % 17 % 16 %\nCanada .............................................. 4 % 16 % 22 %\nOther International .................................... 9 % 10 % 23 %\nTotal Company ........................................ 7 % 16 % 18 %\nChanges in comparable sales:\nU.S. . . ............................................... 3 % 16 % 15 %\nCanada .............................................. 2 % 15 % 20 %\nOther International .................................... 3 % 7 % 19 %\nTotal Company ........................................ 3 % 14 % 16 %\nE-commerce ..........................................

(5)% 10 % 43 %\nNet Sales\nNet sales increased $14,980 or 7% during 2023. The improvement was attributable to an increase in\ncomparable sales of 3%, sales at new warehouses opened in 2022 and 2023, and one additional week of\nsales in 2023. Sales increased $12,761, or 7% in core merchandise categories, led by foods and sundries\nand fresh foods; while non-foods decreased. Sales increased $2,219, or 5% in warehouse ancillary and\nother businesses, led by pharmacy, food court, and travel.\nDuring 2023, changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales by\napproximately $3,484, 156 basis points, compared to 2022, attributable to our Canadian and Other\nInternational operations. The volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 7%, positively impacting\nnet sales by $2,148, or 96 basis points. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $1,592, or\n71 basis points, compared to 2022, with a 6% decrease in the average price per gallon.\nComparable Sales\nComparable sales increased 3% during 2023 and were positively impacted by increases in shopping\nfrequency, partially offset by a decrease in average ticket.\nMembership Fees\n2023 2022 2021\nMembership fees ......................................... $ 4,580 $ 4,224 $ 3,877\nMembership fees increase ................................. 8 % 9 % 9 %\n24\nMembership fee revenue increased 8% in 2023, driven by new member sign-ups, upgrades to Executive\nmembership, and the benefit of an additional week. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S.\ndollar negatively impacted membership fees by $76 compared to 2022. At the end of 2023, our member\nrenewal rates were 92.7% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.4% worldwide. More members auto renewing\nand higher penetration of Executive members benefit renewal rates. Our renewal rate, which excludes\naffiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to\neighteen months prior to the reporting date.\nWe account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, recognized ratably over the one-year\nmembership period.\nGross Margin\n2023 2022 2021\nNet sales ................................................ $ 237,710 $ 222,730 $ 192,052\nLess merchandise costs ................................... 212,586 199,382 170,684\nGross margin ............................................. $ 25,124 $ 23,348 $ 21,368\nGross margin percentage .................................. 10.57 % 10.48 % 11.13 %\nGross margin percentage increased nine basis points compared to 2022. Excluding the impact of\ngasoline price deflation on net sales, gross margin was 10.50%, an increase of two basis points. This two\nbasis point increase was positively impacted by: 18 basis points due to a smaller LIFO charge in 2023\ncompared to 2022, and seven basis points due to core merchandise categories, predominantly foods and\nsundries. These were offset by: 16 basis points due to the downsizing and then discontinuation of our\ncharter shipping activities; four basis points due to increased 2% rewards; and three basis points due to\nwarehouse ancillary and other businesses, predominantly e-commerce, partially offset by gasoline and\nbusiness centers. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross\nmargin by approximately $349, compared to 2022, attributable to our Canadian and Other International\nOperations.\nThe gross margin in core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise\nsales (rather than total net sales), increased two basis points, driven by foods and sundries and non\x02foods, partially offset by fresh foods. This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration\nand gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses.\nGross margin onasegment basis, when expressed as a percentage of the segment's own sales and\nexcluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales (segment gross margin percentage),\nincreased in our U.S. segment, due to a smaller LIFO charge and increases in core merchandise\ncategories, primarily foods and sundries, partially offset by the charges related to the discontinuation of\nour charter shipping activities discussed above and warehouse ancillary and other businesses. Gross\nmargin percentage increased in our Canada segment, attributable to increases in core merchandise\ncategories and warehouse ancillary and other businesses. Our Other International gross margin\npercentage decreased, largely due to decreases in core merchandise categories, partially offset by\nwarehouse ancillary and other businesses. All segments were negatively impacted by increased 2%\nrewards.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\n2023 2022 2021\nSG&A expenses .................... ...................... $ 21,590 $ 19,779 $ 18,537\nSG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales ................ 9.08 % 8.88 % 9.65 %\n25\nSG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 20 basis points compared to 2022. SG&A\nexpenses as a percentage of net sales excluding the impact of gasoline price deflation was 9.02%, an\nincrease of 14 basis points. The comparison to last year was negatively impacted by 16 basis points in\nwarehouse operations and other businesses, largely driven by wage increases effective in March and July\n2022, and March 2023, as well as lower sales growth. Central operating costs were also higher by six\nbasis points. SG&A was positively impacted by eight basis points due to the prior year's write-off of\ninformation technology assets and a charge related to granting our employees additional vacation.\nChanges in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar decreased SG&A expenses by approximately\n$281 compared to 2022, attributable to our Canadian and Other International Operations.\nInterest Expense\n2023 2022 2021\nInterest expense .......................................... $ 160 $ 158 $ 171\nInterest expense is primarily related to Senior Notes and financing leases.

Excluding discrete net tax benefits, the tax rate was 26.6%.\nThe effective tax rate for 2022 was impacted by net discrete tax benefits of $130, primarily due to excess\ntax benefits related to stock compensation. Excluding discrete net tax benefits, the tax rate was 26.2%.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe following table summarizes our significant sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents:\n2023 2022 2021\nNet cash provided by operating activities ..................... $ 11,068 $ 7,392 $ 8,958\nNet cash used in investing activities .........................

Net cash from operations was $2.8 \nbillion and free cash flow was $1.8 billion. These results \nreflect global nitrogen industry conditions favorable to \nour North American-based production network, as we \nbenefitted from wide energy spreads between low-cost \nNorth American natural gas and high-cost natural gas used \nby producers in Europe and Asia. We also saw continued \nstrong execution across our business that included \nproducing 9.5 million tons of gross ammonia for the year. \nWe believe operational excellence, outstanding safety \nand resulting high asset utilization, is a hallmark of the CF \nIndustries team. This has consistently supported our ability \nto create substantial value for our long-term shareholders. \nSince the beginning of 2021: \nFellow \nCF Industries \nShareholders:\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT\nWe invested approximately $1.4 billion in cash to grow \nour production capacity and our cash generation \ncapability. This includes both our initial clean \nenergy projects (Donaldsonville carbon capture and \nsequestration and green ammonia) and the purchase of \nthe Waggaman ammonia production facility in Louisiana \nin December 2023. The Waggaman acquisition will deliver \nimmediate profitable growth by adding one of the newest \nand most energy efficient ammonia production units in \nNorth America into our existing network while advancing \nour long-term strategic focus on low-carbon ammonia as \na clean energy source. \nOur strong operational and financial results \nand commitment to reward long-term \nshareholders have contributed to our record of \noutperformance in total shareholder return. We \nhave exceeded our peer group on a 1-, 3-, 5-, 7- \nand 10-year basis and exceeded the Dow Jones \nU.S. Commodity Chemicals Index on a 3-, 5- and \n7-year basis and the S&P 500 on a 3- and 7-year \nbasis, with a similar return on a 5-year basis. \nWe invested another $1.3 billion in sustaining \nmaintenance activities that improve production \nsafety, efficiency, and reliability, and ultimately cash\x02generation capability, of our industry-leading assets. \nWe deployed $2.5 billion to repurchase more than \n31 million shares, approximately 15% of the shares \noutstanding at the beginning of 2021. In 2023, we \ncommenced a new $3 billion share repurchase \nprogram that expires in December 2025. \nWe returned $877 million to shareholders through \ndividend payments, with the dividend now 67% higher \nthan it was at the end of 2020 following increases \napproved by our Board of Directors in April 2022 and \nJanuary 2024.\nCF INDUSTRIES 2023 ANNUAL REPORT 2\nWHAT WE DO\nAt our core, CF Industries is a producer of ammonia. We use the Haber-Bosch process to fix atmospheric nitrogen with hydrogen from \nnatural gas to produce anhydrous ammonia, whose chemical composition is NH3\n. We then choose to sell the ammonia itself or upgrade it \ninto ammonia-derived products such as granular urea, urea ammonium nitrate solutions (UAN) and diesel exhaust fluid (DEF). \nWe are the largest producer of ammonia in the world. The 16 ammonia plants in our network, which are all located in North America, have a \ntotal annual average capacity of 10.4 million tons. We produce ammonia and/or ammonia-derived products at nine manufacturing facilities. \nWe have significant advantages compared to our peers that underpin our cash generation capability. \nWe also continually invest in the training and development of our \nteam. We are focused on ensuring that all employees – from new \nhires to executives – have access to the tools and knowledge \nthey need to grow their careers and reach their potential. Our \ncommitment to growth and development includes on-the-job \ntraining, professional and technical development, leadership \ndevelopment and tuition reimbursement programs. \nUnderpinned by outstanding safety performance, we \nconsistently deliver capacity utilization rates well above \nour peers. We have built, and maintain to the highest \nstandards, what we believe to be the industry’s most \nreliable, efficient, and flexible assets. This operational \nexcellence leads to capital and operating efficiency, \nsaving our shareholders billions of dollars of capital and \nthe accompanying annual maintenance and overhead \ncosts while allowing us to produce meaningfully greater \nvolumes of ammonia with the same assets. \nOur access to low-cost and plentiful North American \nnatural gas provides a significant production margin \nadvantage. \nTotal Recordable Incident Rate North American Ammonia Percent of Capacity Utilization (1)\nAs of December 31, 2023, our 12-month rolling average \nrecordable incident rate was 0.36 per 200,000 work hours\nCF’s 10% greater capacity utilization yields an additional \n~0.9 million tons of ammonia annually(4)\nBLS Fertilizer Manufacturing North America Excl.

Simply,\nammonia is one of the most important chemical compounds on\nearth, essential to human life.\nFor decades, CF Industries has focused on producing and selling\nammonia and other ammonia-derived products for use as nitrogen\nfertilizer. The nitrogen content in these products provides energy\nto crops to increase yields and is critical to the formation of protein\nwithin the plant.\nAlong with advancements in seed technology and farming\npractices, the use of nitrogen fertilizer and other nutrients\ndramatically increased food production in the second half of the\n1900s, supporting world population growth and lifting countless\npeople out of hunger. It is estimated that fertilizer is responsible for\n50% of the world’s food. At the same time, fertilizer allows more\nfood to be grown on fewer acres. This reduces the amount of land\ncleared for agriculture, preserving carbon-sequestering forests and\nthe biodiversity of wildlife ecosystems.\nMore recently, we have grown a business focused on emissions \nreduction. We are one of the world’s largest producers of DEF. \nDEF, when combined with selective catalytic reduction \ntechnology, reduces nitrogen oxide (NOX) emissions from diesel \ntrucks by up to 90% and increases fuel efficiency by 3-4%. \nToday we have an opportunity to strengthen our existing business\nand set the Company on a significant growth trajectory by doing\nwhat we do best – produce ammonia – while significantly reducing\nthe carbon emissions associated with ammonia production. We\nbelieve that doing so:\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT\nIs the right thing to do, in line with our long-standing \ncommitment to environmental stewardship and \nour stakeholders’ and society’s interests in reducing \ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. \nMeets growing interest in low-carbon ammonia and \nlow-carbon nitrogen fertilizers for traditional agriculture\x02related applications to lower the carbon footprint of food \nproduction and enable ethanol as a sustainable aviation \nfuel. The use of low-carbon nitrogen fertilizer as a clean \nenergy source to increase crop yields is a certifiable and \nquantifiable pathway to achieve these objectives. \nPositions the Company to succeed under new \nregulatory regimes. \nUnlocks new growth opportunities from energy-intensive \nindustries, such as power generation and marine \nshipping, that have identified ammonia as a clean energy \nsource. This is due to the hydrogen atoms that make \nup a molecule of ammonia. Hydrogen is widely viewed \nas a scalable source of clean energy, and ammonia \nrepresents an efficient mechanism to both ship and store \nhydrogen, as well as a clean energy source in its own right \nas ammonia does not contain or emit carbon. The use \nof ammonia for its clean energy capability represents \na significant source of new demand for those who can \nproduce low-carbon ammonia. \nCF INDUSTRIES 2023 ANNUAL REPORT 4\nAt the end of 2023, the installation of one of the world’s \nlargest alkaline water electrolyzers at our Donaldsonville \nComplex in Louisiana was mechanically complete. This gives \nour Company the ability to produce up to 20,000 tons of \ngreen ammonia annually (ammonia produced with hydrogen \nfrom water through an electrolysis process that produces \nno carbon emissions). This represents North America’s first \ncommercial-scale green ammonia capacity.\nIn 2023, our Board of Directors reviewed roadmaps to achieve \nour 2030 and 2050 decarbonization goals. These roadmaps \nidentify projects we believe we can execute in the coming years \n– such as implementing CCS at our Medicine Hat, Yazoo City \nand Waggaman sites – as well as identify the sources of GHG \nemissions from our facilities that require additional technology \ndevelopment and are thus longer-term focus areas.\nWe believe our industry-leading capabilities, decarbonization \ncommitments, and the concrete steps we have taken towards \nour goals make us a producer and partner of choice for those who \nshare our view of low-carbon ammonia’s potential to support \nthe world’s transition to clean energy. We continue to take a \ndisciplined approach to these opportunities, and remain focused \non ensuring the greenfield low-carbon ammonia production \ncapacity we have been evaluating with partners is well-matched \nwith global demand.\nOUR STRATEGY\nAs a result, our strategy is to leverage our unique capabilities to \naccelerate the world’s transition to clean energy.\nDecarbonization is at the heart of this strategy. As we \ndecarbonize, we will be doing our part while providing clean \nenergy to existing and new customers so that they can \ndecarbonize their industries. We believe this will enable us to \ngrow profitably while doing good for the environment.\nOur committed goals include reducing Scope 1 CO2-equivalent \nemissions intensity by 25% by 2030 (compared to a 2015 \nbaseline) and achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. We \nalso have committed to reducing our Scope 3 emissions by 10% \nby 2030. \nWe have made tangible progress against these goals.\nOur landmark carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) \nproject, also at Donaldsonville, continues to advance and is \nexpected to start-up in 2025. Once operational, our partner \nExxonMobil will sequester 2 million tons of carbon dioxide \nannually from our facility that would otherwise be emitted to \nthe atmosphere. \nIn 2023, we expanded our efforts to address our Scope 3 \nemissions by entering into an agreement with bp to purchase \n4.4 billion cubic feet of certified natural gas in 2024, which is \ndouble our purchase in 2023. This natural gas is certified by \nnot-for-profit MiQ to have a 90% lower methane emissions \nintensity - the ratio of methane emissions to natural gas \nproduced - than the industry average. Methane emissions are \nthe second largest source of our Scope 3 emissions.\nCF INDUSTRIES 5\nCREATING LONG-TERM SHAREHOLDER VALUE\nAs we execute our strategy, we expect to generate superior free \ncash flow supported by exciting growth opportunities within our \nbusiness. Our goal is to increase our cash generation and your \nparticipation in our free cash flow.

All references to “CF Industries” refer to CF Industries, Inc., a 100% owned subsidiary of CF Industries \nHoldings, Inc. References to tons refer to short tons and references to tonnes refer to metric tons. Notes referenced throughout \nthis document refer to consolidated financial statement note disclosures that are found in Item 8. Financial Statements and \nSupplementary Data—Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur mission is to provide clean energy to feed and fuel the world sustainably. With our employees focused on safe and \nreliable operations, environmental stewardship, and disciplined capital and corporate management, we are on a path to \ndecarbonize our ammonia production network – the world’s largest – to enable green and low-carbon hydrogen and nitrogen \nproducts for energy, fertilizer, emissions abatement and other industrial activities. Our nitrogen manufacturing complexes in the \nUnited States, Canada and the United Kingdom, an extensive storage, transportation and distribution network in North America, \nand logistics capabilities enabling a global reach underpin our strategy to leverage our unique capabilities to accelerate the \nworld’s transition to clean energy. Our principal customers are cooperatives, independent fertilizer distributors, traders, \nwholesalers and industrial users. Our core product is anhydrous ammonia (ammonia), which contains 82% nitrogen and 18% \nhydrogen. Our nitrogen products that are upgraded from ammonia are granular urea, urea ammonium nitrate solution (UAN) \nand ammonium nitrate (AN). Our other nitrogen products include diesel exhaust fluid (DEF), urea liquor, nitric acid and aqua \nammonia, which are sold primarily to our industrial customers. \nOur principal assets as of December 31, 2023 include:\n• six U.S. nitrogen manufacturing facilities, located in Donaldsonville, Louisiana (the largest nitrogen complex in \nthe world); Sergeant Bluff, Iowa (our Port Neal complex); Yazoo City, Mississippi; Claremore, Oklahoma (our \nVerdigris complex); Woodward, Oklahoma; and Waggaman, Louisiana. The Waggaman facility is wholly owned \nby us, and the other five U.S. nitrogen manufacturing facilities are wholly owned directly or indirectly by CF \nIndustries Nitrogen, LLC (CFN), of which we own approximately 89% and CHS Inc. (CHS) owns the remainder;\n• two Canadian nitrogen manufacturing facilities, located in Medicine Hat, Alberta (the largest nitrogen complex in \nCanada) and Courtright, Ontario; \n• a United Kingdom nitrogen manufacturing facility located in Billingham;\n• an extensive system of terminals and associated transportation equipment located primarily in the Midwestern \nUnited States; and\n• a 50% interest in Point Lisas Nitrogen Limited (PLNL), an ammonia production joint venture located in the \nRepublic of Trinidad and Tobago (Trinidad) that we account for under the equity method.\nWe have a strategic venture with CHS under which CHS owns an equity interest in CFN, a subsidiary of CF Holdings, \nwhich represents approximately 11% of the membership interests of CFN. We own the remaining membership interests. CHS \nalso receives deliveries pursuant to a supply agreement under which CHS has the right to purchase annually from CFN up to \napproximately 1.1 million tons of granular urea and 580,000 tons of UAN at market prices. As a result of its minority equity \ninterest in CFN, CHS is entitled to semi-annual cash distributions from CFN. We are also entitled to semi-annual cash \ndistributions from CFN. See Note 19—Noncontrolling Interest for additional information on our strategic venture with CHS.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we sold 19.1 million, 18.3 million and 18.5 million product tons \ngenerating net sales of $6.63 billion, $11.19 billion and $6.54 billion, respectively.\nOur principal executive offices are located outside of Chicago, Illinois, at 2375 Waterview Drive, Northbrook, Illinois \n60062, and our telephone number is 847-405-2400.

Copies of our Corporate Governance \nGuidelines, Code of Corporate Conduct and charters for the Audit Committee, Compensation and Management Development \nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\n1\nCommittee, Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, and Environmental Sustainability and Community Committee \nof our Board of Directors (the Board) are also available on our Internet website. We will provide electronic or paper copies of \nthese documents free of charge upon request. The SEC also maintains a website at www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and \ninformation statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.\nOur Strategy\nOur strategy is to leverage our unique capabilities to accelerate the world’s transition to clean energy. We believe this \nstrategy builds upon the Company’s leadership in ammonia production to capture emerging opportunities available to ammonia \nproduced with a lower carbon intensity than that of ammonia produced through traditional processes. These opportunities \ninclude traditional applications in agriculture to help reduce the carbon footprint of food production and the life cycle carbon \nintensity of ethanol production, enabling its use for sustainable aviation fuel, among other purposes. They also include new \napplications, such as power generation and marine shipping, that would use the hydrogen component of the ammonia molecule \nfor clean energy given that ammonia does not contain or emit carbon when combusted. \nWe execute our strategy across four dimensions: decarbonizing our existing network to accelerate the availability of low\x02carbon ammonia; evaluating new low-carbon ammonia capacity growth; forging partnerships to accelerate our timeline and \nbridge gaps in areas where we do not have expertise; and collaborating to build understanding of ammonia’s clean energy \ncapability, safety track record and regulatory environment.\nDecarbonization projects in our existing network include our green ammonia project at our Donaldsonville, Louisiana \ncomplex. Green ammonia refers to ammonia produced with hydrogen sourced through an electrolysis process that produces no \ncarbon emissions. In April 2021, we signed an engineering and procurement contract with thyssenkrupp to supply a 20 MW \nalkaline water electrolysis plant to produce green hydrogen at our Donaldsonville complex. We will integrate the green \nhydrogen generated by the electrolysis plant into existing ammonia synthesis loops to enable the production of approximately \n20,000 tons per year of green ammonia. The green hydrogen production facility is mechanically complete, and commissioning \nactivities began in early 2024. We believe that the Donaldsonville green ammonia project will be the largest of its kind in North \nAmerica at the time of its startup. \nDecarbonization projects in our existing network also include the production of low-carbon ammonia. Low-carbon \nammonia is ammonia produced by conventional processes but with approximately 60-98% of the process and flue gas CO2\ngenerated by ammonia production removed through carbon capture and sequestration (CCS). We are executing a project also at \nour Donaldsonville complex that will enable us to produce a significant volume of low-carbon ammonia. At an estimated cost \nof $200 million, we are constructing a CO2 dehydration and compression facility to enable CCS at the facility. Engineering \nactivities for the construction of the dehydration and compression unit continue to advance, all major equipment for the facility \nhas been procured, fabrication of the CO2 compressors is proceeding, and construction activities at the Donaldsonville site are \nunderway. Once the dehydration and compression unit is in service and sequestration is initiated, we expect that the \nDonaldsonville complex will have the capacity to dehydrate and compress up to 2 million tons per year of process CO2, thereby \nconverting a portion of our existing ammonia production to low-carbon ammonia. In October 2022, we announced that we had \nentered into a definitive CO2 offtake agreement with ExxonMobil to transport and permanently sequester the CO2 from \nDonaldsonville. Start-up for the project is planned for 2025. Under current regulations, the project would be expected to qualify \nfor tax credits under Section 45Q of the Internal Revenue Code, which provides a credit per tonne of CO2 sequestered.\nAlongside these projects, we are also evaluating the construction of greenfield low-carbon ammonia capacity in \nLouisiana. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we and Mitsui & Co., Ltd. (Mitsui) completed a front-end engineering and design \n(FEED) study on a greenfield steam methane reforming (SMR) ammonia facility with CCS technologies. The FEED study \nestimates the cost of a project with these attributes to be in the range of $3 billion, with approximately $2.5 billion allocated to \nthe ammonia facility and CCS technologies and approximately $500 million allocated to scalable common infrastructure for the \nsite, such as ammonia storage and vessel loading docks. \nWe and Mitsui are progressing two additional FEED studies focused on technologies with the potential to further reduce \nthe carbon intensity of the proposed low-carbon ammonia facility, including a FEED study evaluating autothermal reforming \n(ATR) ammonia production technology and a FEED study assessing the cost and viability of adding flue gas capture to an SMR \nammonia facility. We expect to complete both FEED studies in the second half of 2024. \nWe and Mitsui are targeting the second half of 2024 for the final investment decision on the proposed greenfield low\x02carbon ammonia facility. Should the companies agree to move forward, the ammonia facility would be constructed at our new \nBlue Point complex. We own the land for the complex, which is located on the west bank of the Mississippi river in Ascension \nParish, Louisiana. Construction and commissioning of a new world-scale ammonia plant typically takes approximately four \nyears from the time construction begins. \nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\n2\nIn addition to ongoing discussions with existing customers who have interest in forthcoming availability of low-carbon \nammonia for traditional applications, we are engaged in advanced discussions regarding the supply of low-carbon ammonia for \nnew applications. In the first quarter of 2023, we signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with JERA Co., Inc. (JERA), \nJapan’s largest energy generator, regarding the long-term supply of up to 500,000 tonnes per year of clean ammonia beginning \nin 2027. The execution of the MOU was the result of a supplier comparison and evaluation process for the procurement of clean \nammonia that JERA initiated in February 2022 for the world’s first commercial scale ammonia co-firing operations that JERA \nis developing. The MOU establishes a framework for JERA and us to assess how we would best supply JERA with clean \nammonia, which will be required to be produced with at least 60% lower carbon emissions than conventionally produced \nammonia, under a long-term offtake agreement. We and JERA are evaluating a range of potential supply options, including \nJERA making an equity investment with us to develop a clean ammonia facility in Louisiana and a supplementary long-term \nofftake agreement. \nWe are also evaluating and in various stages of developing discussions and agreements with other companies for clean \nammonia long-term offtake opportunities related to new applications of ammonia.\nCompany History\nWe were founded in 1946 as Central Farmers Fertilizer Company, and were owned by a group of regional agriculture \ncooperatives for the first 59 years of our existence. Central Farmers became CF Industries in 1970. \nOriginally established as a fertilizer brokerage company, we expanded owning and operating fertilizer manufacturing and \ndistribution facilities in the early 1950s with a principal objective of assured supply for our owners. At various times in our \nhistory, we manufactured and/or distributed nitrogen, phosphate and potash fertilizers.\nWe operated as a traditional manufacturing and supply cooperative until 2002, when we adopted a new business model \nthat established financial performance as our principal objective, rather than assured supply for our owners. A critical aspect of \nthe new business model was to establish a more economically driven approach to the marketplace.\nIn August 2005, we completed the initial public offering (IPO) of our common stock, which is listed on the New York \nStock Exchange. In connection with the IPO, we consummated a reorganization transaction whereby we ceased to be a \ncooperative and our pre-IPO owners’ equity interests in CF Industries were cancelled in exchange for all of the proceeds of the \noffering and shares of our common stock. At the time of the IPO, our assets consisted of one wholly owned nitrogen \nmanufacturing facility in Louisiana, United States; a joint venture nitrogen manufacturing facility in Alberta, Canada, of which \nwe owned 66 percent; a phosphate mining and manufacturing operation in Florida, United States; and distribution facilities \nthroughout North America.\nIn April 2010, we acquired Terra Industries Inc. (Terra), a leading North American producer and marketer of nitrogen \nfertilizer products for a purchase price of $4.6 billion, which was paid in cash and shares of our common stock. As a result of \nthe Terra acquisition, we acquired five nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities; an approximately 75.3% interest in Terra \nNitrogen Company, L.P. (TNCLP), a publicly traded limited partnership; and certain joint venture interests.\n Prior to April 30, 2013, we owned 66 percent of Canadian Fertilizers Limited (CFL), a joint venture nitrogen \nmanufacturing facility in Alberta, Canada. On April 30, 2013, CF Industries acquired all of the outstanding interests in CFL that \nit did not already own and CFL became our wholly owned subsidiary.\nIn March 2014, we exited our phosphate mining and manufacturing business, which was located in Florida, through a sale \nto The Mosaic Company. As a result, we became focused solely on nitrogen manufacturing and distribution.\nIn July 2015, we acquired the remaining 50% equity interest in CF Fertilisers UK Group Limited (formerly known as \nGrowHow UK Group Limited) (CF Fertilisers UK) not previously owned by us, and CF Fertilisers UK became wholly owned \nby us. This transaction added CF Fertilisers UK’s nitrogen manufacturing complexes in Ince, United Kingdom and Billingham, \nUnited Kingdom to our consolidated manufacturing capacity. Due to the substantial increase in the cost of natural gas in the \nUnited Kingdom, in 2022, we closed the Ince facility, and in 2023, we ceased operations of the ammonia plant at the \nBillingham facility, which was idled in September 2022. Since that time, we have imported ammonia for upgrade into AN and \nother nitrogen products at the Billingham facility.\nIn February 2016, our strategic venture with CHS commenced, at which time CHS made a capital contribution of \n$2.8 billion to CFN in exchange for membership interests in CFN, which represented approximately 11% of the total \nmembership interests of CFN.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\n3\nIn late 2015 and 2016, we completed capacity expansion projects at our Donaldsonville complex in Louisiana and our \nPort Neal complex in Iowa. These projects, originally announced in 2012, included the construction of new ammonia, urea, and \nUAN plants at our Donaldsonville complex and new ammonia and urea plants at our Port Neal complex. These plants increased \nour overall production capacity by approximately 25%, improved our product mix flexibility at Donaldsonville, and improved \nour ability to serve upper-Midwest urea customers from our Port Neal location. The total capital cost of the capacity expansion \nprojects was $5.2 billion.\nPrior to April 2, 2018, Terra Nitrogen, Limited Partnership, which owns and operates our Verdigris nitrogen \nmanufacturing facility in Oklahoma, was a subsidiary of TNCLP. On April 2, 2018, Terra Nitrogen GP Inc., the sole general \npartner of TNCLP and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of CF Holdings, completed its purchase of all of the publicly traded \ncommon units of TNCLP (the Purchase). Upon completion of the Purchase, CF Holdings owned, through its subsidiaries, 100 \npercent of the general and limited partnership interests of TNCLP. \nOn December 1, 2023, we acquired an ammonia production facility located in Waggaman, Louisiana from Dyno Nobel \nLouisiana Ammonia, LLC (DNLA), a U.S. subsidiary of Australia-based Incitec Pivot Limited (IPL), pursuant to an asset \npurchase agreement with DNLA and IPL. The facility has a nameplate capacity of 880,000 tons of ammonia annually. In \nconnection with the closing of the acquisition on December 1, 2023, we entered into a long-term ammonia offtake agreement \nproviding for us to supply up to 200,000 tons of ammonia per year to IPL’s Dyno Nobel, Inc. subsidiary. Under the terms of the \nasset purchase agreement, $425 million of the $1.675 billion purchase price, subject to adjustment, was allocated by the parties \nto the ammonia offtake agreement. We funded the balance of the purchase price with $1.223 billion of cash on hand. \nProduct Tons and Nutrient Tons\nUnless otherwise stated, we measure our production and sales volume in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in product \ntons, which represents the weight of the product measured in short tons (one short ton is equal to 2,000 pounds). References to \nUAN product tons assume a 32% nitrogen content basis for production volume. \nWe also provide certain supplementary volume information measured in nutrient tons. Nutrient tons represent the weight \nof the product’s nitrogen content, which varies by product. Ammonia represents 82% nitrogen content, granular urea represents \n46% nitrogen content, UAN represents between 28% and 32% nitrogen content and AN represents between 29% and 35% \nnitrogen content. \nReportable Segments\nOur reportable segments consist of the following segments: Ammonia, Granular Urea, UAN, AN and Other. These \nsegments are differentiated by products. We use gross margin to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Total \nother operating costs and expenses (consisting primarily of selling, general and administrative expenses and other operating—\nnet) and non-operating expenses (consisting primarily of interest and income taxes), are centrally managed and are not included \nin the measurement of segment profitability reviewed by management.

The facility consists of two ammonia plants, three urea plants, two nitric acid plants and one UAN plant. The \nlocation has on-site storage for 82,000 tons of ammonia, 130,000 tons of granular urea, and 100,000 tons of 32% UAN.\nClaremore, Oklahoma (the Verdigris facility) \nThe Verdigris facility is located northeast of Tulsa, Oklahoma, near the Verdigris River, in Claremore, Oklahoma. It is \nthe second largest UAN production facility in North America. The facility consists of two ammonia plants, two nitric acid \nplants, two UAN plants and a port terminal. We lease the port terminal from the Tulsa-Rogers County Port Authority. The \ncomplex has on-site storage for 57,000 tons of ammonia and 102,000 tons of 32% UAN.\nWaggaman, Louisiana\nThe Waggaman facility is located near New Orleans, Louisiana on the Mississippi River approximately 60 miles \nsoutheast of the Donaldsonville facility. The facility consists of one ammonia plant, has access to an ammonia pipeline, and has \non-site storage for approximately 39,000 tons of ammonia. \nWoodward, Oklahoma\nThe Woodward facility is located in rural northwest Oklahoma and consists of one ammonia plant, two nitric acid plants, \ntwo urea plants and two UAN plants. The facility has on-site storage for 34,000 tons of ammonia and 84,000 tons of 32% UAN.\nYazoo City, Mississippi\nThe Yazoo City facility is located in central Mississippi and includes one ammonia plant, four nitric acid plants, one AN \nplant, two urea plants, one UAN plant and a dinitrogen tetroxide production and storage facility. The site has on-site storage for \n48,000 tons of ammonia, 47,000 tons of 32% UAN and 10,000 tons of AN and related products.\nCourtright, Ontario, Canada\nThe Courtright facility is located south of Sarnia, Ontario near the St. Clair River. The facility consists of an ammonia \nplant, a UAN plant, a nitric acid plant and a urea plant. The location has on-site storage for 61,000 tons of ammonia and 16,000 \ntons of 32% UAN.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\n6\nBillingham, United Kingdom\nThe Billingham facility, located in the Teesside chemical area in northeastern England, is geographically split among \nthree primary locations: the main site, which contains three nitric acid plants; the Portrack site, approximately two miles away, \nwhich contains an AN fertilizer plant; and the North Tees site, approximately seven miles away, which contains an ammonia \nstorage area. These locations collectively have on-site storage for 37,000 tons of ammonia and 138,000 tons of AN. In addition, \nwe used to operate an ammonia plant at the main site of the Billingham facility. However, in September 2022, we idled \nammonia production at the facility. Since that time, we have imported ammonia for upgrade at the facility into AN and other \nnitrogen products. In the third quarter of 2023, we approved our plan to permanently close the ammonia plant at the Billingham \nfacility.\nPoint Lisas, Trinidad\nThe Point Lisas Nitrogen facility in Trinidad is owned jointly through a 50/50 venture with Koch Fertilizer LLC. This \nfacility has the capacity to produce 720,000 tons of ammonia annually from natural gas supplied under a contract with The \nNational Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited (NGC).\nNitrogen Product Raw Materials\nNatural gas is the principal raw material and primary fuel source used in the ammonia production process at our nitrogen \nmanufacturing facilities. In 2023, natural gas accounted for approximately 40% of our total production costs for nitrogen \nproducts. Our nitrogen manufacturing facilities have access to abundant, competitively-priced natural gas through a reliable \nnetwork of pipelines that are connected to major natural gas trading hubs. Our facilities utilize the following natural gas hubs: \nHenry Hub, SONAT and TETCO ELA in Louisiana; ONEOK in Oklahoma; AECO in Alberta; Ventura in Iowa; Demarcation \nin Kansas; Welcome in Minnesota; Dawn and Parkway in Ontario; and the National Balancing Point (NBP) in the United \nKingdom.\nIn 2023, our nitrogen manufacturing facilities consumed, in the aggregate, approximately 340 million MMBtus of natural \ngas. We employ a combination of daily spot and term purchases from a variety of quality suppliers to maintain a reliable, \ncompetitively-priced supply of natural gas. We also use certain financial instruments to hedge natural gas prices. See Note 17—\nDerivative Financial Instruments for additional information about our natural gas hedging activities.\nNitrogen Product Distribution\nThe safe, efficient and economical distribution of nitrogen products is critical for successful operations. Our nitrogen \nproduction facilities have access to multiple transportation modes by which we ship products to terminals, warehouses and \ncustomers. Each of our production facilities has a unique distribution pattern based on its production capacity and location.\nOur North American nitrogen production facilities can ship products via truck and rail to customers and to our storage \nfacilities in the U.S. and Canada, with access to our leased railcar fleet of approximately 4,900 tank and hopper cars, as well as \nrailcars provided by rail carriers. Our United Kingdom nitrogen production facility mainly ships products via truck. \nThe North American waterway system is also used extensively to ship products from our Donaldsonville, Verdigris and \nYazoo City facilities. To ship ammonia and UAN, we employ a fleet of up to eleven tow boats and thirty-six river barges, \nwhich are primarily leased. We also utilize contract marine services to move granular urea and AN. We can also export nitrogen \nproducts via seagoing vessels from our Donaldsonville and Billingham manufacturing facilities.\nThe Donaldsonville and Waggaman facilities are connected to the 2,000-mile long Nustar pipeline through which we \nhave the ability to transport ammonia to ten terminals and shipping points in the Midwestern U.S. corn belt.\nStorage Facilities and Other Properties\nAs of December 31, 2023, we owned or leased space at 48 in-market storage terminals and warehouses located in a 22-\nstate region of the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. Including storage at our production facilities, we have an \naggregate storage capacity for approximately 3.0 million tons of product. Our storage capabilities are summarized in the \nfollowing table: \nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\n7\nAmmonia Granular Urea UAN(1) AN\nNumber of\nFacilities\nCapacity\n(000 Tons)\nNumber of\nFacilities\nCapacity\n(000 Tons)\nNumber of\nFacilities\nCapacity\n(000 Tons)\nNumber of\nFacilities\nCapacity\n(000 Tons)\nPlants . . . . . . . . . . . . 9 552 3 315 6 551 2 148 \nTerminal and \nWarehouse Locations\nOwned(2) . . . . . . . . 22 766 — — 9 244 — — \nLeased(3) . . . . . . . . 5 69 3 35 19 279 — — \nTotal In-Market . . 27 835 3 35 28 523 — — \nTotal Storage \nCapacity . . . . . . . . . . 1,387 350 1,074 148 \n_______________________________________________________________________________\n(1) Capacity is expressed as the equivalent volume of UAN measured on a 32% nitrogen content basis.\n(2) The owned facilities that store UAN also can store ammonia.\n(3) Our lease agreements are typically for periods of one to five years and commonly contain provisions for automatic renewal that can \nextend the lease term unless cancelled by either party.\nCustomers\nThe principal customers for our nitrogen products are cooperatives, independent fertilizer distributors, traders, \nwholesalers and industrial users. Sales are generated by our internal marketing and sales force. CHS was our largest customer in \n2023 and accounted for approximately 13% of our consolidated net sales. We have a strategic venture with CHS under which \nCHS has a minority equity interest in CFN. See Note 19—Noncontrolling Interest for additional information on our strategic \nventure with CHS. \nCompetition\nOur markets are global and intensely competitive, based primarily on delivered price and, to a lesser extent, on reliability, \ncustomer service and product quality. During the peak demand periods, product availability and delivery time also play a role in \nthe buying decisions of customers. \nOur primary competitors with North American operations include Nutrien Ltd., Koch Fertilizer LLC, N-7 LLC (a joint \nventure between OCI N.V. and Dakota Gasification Company) and Yara International. There is also significant competition \nfrom products sourced from other regions of the world, including some with lower natural gas or other feedstock costs, which \nmay include the benefit of government subsidies. Because ammonia, urea and UAN are widely-traded fertilizer products and \nthere are limited barriers to entry, we experience competition from foreign-sourced products continuously. Producers of \nnitrogen-based fertilizers located in the Middle East, Trinidad, Africa and Russia have been major exporters to North America \nin recent years.\nOur primary United Kingdom competition comes from imported products supplied by companies including Yara \nInternational, Origin Fertilisers, Ameropa and Thomas Bell & Sons Ltd. Urea and UAN are not produced in the United \nKingdom, but along with AN are widely-traded fertilizer products with limited barriers to entry. \nSeasonality\nThe fertilizer business is seasonal. The degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year \ndue to weather conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors. The strongest demand for our products in North \nAmerica occurs during the spring planting season, with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest. In contrast, \nwe and other fertilizer producers generally manufacture and distribute products throughout the year. As a result, we and/or our \ncustomers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year to ensure timely product availability during the \npeak sales seasons. Seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the short application season and the limited ability of our \ncustomers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product. The seasonality of fertilizer demand generally \nresults in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the \nhighest just prior to the start of the spring planting season. Our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to \nthe next due to weather-related shifts in planting and application schedules and purchasing patterns as well as import timing, \nimport and distribution costs and logistical limitations, such as river conditions.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\n8\nEnvironmental, Health and Safety\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in the United States, Canada, the \nUnited Kingdom, the European Union (EU) and Trinidad, including laws and regulations relating to the generation and \nhandling of hazardous substances and wastes; the introduction of new chemicals or substances into a market; the cleanup of \nhazardous substance releases; the discharge of regulated substances to air or water; and the demolition of existing plant sites \nupon permanent closure. In the United States, these laws include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource \nConservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act \n(CERCLA), the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and various other \nfederal, state and local statutes. Violations of environmental, health and safety laws can result in substantial penalties, court \norders to install pollution-control equipment, civil and criminal sanctions, permit revocations and facility shutdowns. In \naddition, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations may impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault, \nfor cleanup costs on potentially responsible parties who have released or disposed of hazardous substances into the \nenvironment. We may be subject to more stringent enforcement of existing or new environmental, health and safety laws in the \nfuture.\nEnvironmental, Health and Safety Expenditures \nOur environmental, health and safety capital expenditures in 2023 totaled approximately $36 million. We estimate that \nwe will have approximately $47 million of environmental, health and safety capital expenditures in 2024. In addition, to \nsupport safe and reliable operations at our continuous process manufacturing facilities, we conduct scheduled inspections, \nreplacements and overhauls of our plant machinery and equipment, which are referred to as turnarounds. A further description \nof turnaround activities is included in Note 8—Property, Plant and Equipment—Net in the notes to consolidated financial \nstatements included in Item 8 of this report. Environmental, health and safety laws and regulations are complex, change \nfrequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We expect that continued government and public emphasis on \nenvironmental issues will result in increased future expenditures for environmental controls at our manufacturing and \ndistribution facilities. Such expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of \noperations and cash flows. Additionally, future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or reinterpretation of \ncurrent laws and regulations may require us to make substantial expenditures. Our costs to comply with, or any liabilities under, \nthese laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and \ncash flows.\nCERCLA/Remediation Matters \nFrom time to time, we receive notices from governmental agencies or third parties alleging that we are a potentially \nresponsible party at certain cleanup sites under CERCLA or other environmental cleanup laws. In 2011, we received a notice \nfrom the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality (IDEQ) that alleged that we were a potentially responsible party for the \ncleanup of a former phosphate mine site we owned in the late 1950s and early 1960s located in Georgetown Canyon, Idaho. \nThe current owner of the property and a former mining contractor received similar notices for the site. In 2014, we and the \ncurrent property owner entered into a Consent Order with IDEQ and the U.S. Forest Service to conduct a remedial investigation \nand feasibility study of the site. The remedial investigation was submitted to the agencies in 2021. The next step will be a risk \nassessment, followed by a feasibility study. In 2015, we and several other parties received a notice that the U.S. Department of \nthe Interior and other trustees intended to undertake a natural resource damage assessment for 18 former phosphate mines and \nthree former processing facilities in southeast Idaho. The Georgetown Canyon former mine and processing facility was \nincluded in the group of former mines and processing facilities identified by the trustees. In June 2021, we received another \nnotice from the U.S. Department of the Interior that the natural resource damage trustees were commencing a ‘subsequent’ \nphase of the natural resource damage assessment, but no further details were provided with respect to said assessment. Because \nthe former Georgetown Canyon mine site is still in the risk assessment and feasibility study stage, we are not able to estimate at \nthis time our potential liability, if any, with respect to the cleanup of the site or a possible claim for natural resource damages. \nHowever, based on the results of the site investigation conducted to date, we do not expect the remedial or financial obligations \nto which we may be subject involving this or other cleanup sites will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated \nfinancial position, results of operations or cash flows. \nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\n9\nRegulation of Greenhouse Gases \nOur production facilities emit greenhouse gases (GHGs), such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide. Natural gas, a fossil \nfuel, is a primary raw material used in our nitrogen production process. We are subject to GHG regulations in the United \nKingdom, Canada and the United States.\nOur U.K. manufacturing plant is required to report GHG emissions annually to the United Kingdom Environment \nAgency pursuant to its site Environmental Permits and Climate Change Agreement, which specifies energy efficiency targets. \nFailure to meet efficiency targets may require the plant to purchase CO2 emissions allowances. Our U.K. manufacturing plant is \nsubject to the UK Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS), which generally requires us to hold or obtain emission allowances to \noffset GHG emissions from those aspects of our operations that are subject to regulation under this program.\nIn Canada, we are required to conduct an annual review of our operations with respect to compliance with Environment \nCanada’s National Pollutant Release Inventory, Ontario’s Mandatory Monitoring and Reporting Regulation, and the GHG \nReporting Regulation. In addition, our manufacturing plants in Alberta and Ontario are subject to provincial or federal laws that \nimpose a price on excess GHG emissions. Each of these laws establishes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions standards \napplicable to our facilities in terms of emissions per unit of production, with the provincial laws and the federal law using \ndifferent formulas for establishing the intensity-based limits and the reductions in these limits over time. The federal law is the \nGreenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, which came into effect in 2018 and is intended to function only as a backstop to the \nprovincial programs if such programs do not meet minimum federal criteria. In 2022, the federal government found that both \nthe Alberta and Ontario programs for 2023-2030 met such minimum criteria, and therefore, the provincial laws apply. Effective \nJanuary 1, 2023, these provincial regulations increased in stringency from 2022 levels, and we expect that the regulations will \ncontinue to increase in stringency going forward as Canada continues to work toward its stated goal of net zero GHG emissions \nby 2050. If a facility’s CO2e emissions exceed the applicable limit, the excess emissions must be offset, either through \nobtaining qualifying emission credits or by making a payment for each ton of excess emissions. For calendar year 2024, the \nexcess emissions fee under the federal, Alberta and Ontario regulatory programs is CAD $80 per tonne, which fee will increase \nby CAD $15 per tonne per year, reaching CAD $170 per tonne by 2030.\nIn the United States, GHG regulation is evolving at state, regional and federal levels, although some of the more \nsignificant developments to date, including efforts of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate \nGHG emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants, do not directly impose obligations on our facilities. The EPA issued a \nmandatory GHG reporting rule that required all of our U.S. manufacturing facilities, which are considered large emitters of \nGHGs, to commence monitoring GHG emissions beginning on January 1, 2010 and reporting the previous year’s emissions \nannually starting in 2011. In addition, if we seek to modify or expand any of our major facilities and as a result, are required to \nobtain a Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) construction permit applicable to such facilities, we could be subject to \npollution control requirements applicable to GHGs in addition to requirements applicable to conventional air pollutants. Such \nrequirements may result in increased costs or delays in completing such projects. Other than the states’ implementation of this \npermitting requirement, none of the states where our U.S. production facilities are located – Iowa, Louisiana, Mississippi and \nOklahoma – has proposed control regulations limiting GHG emissions.\nIncreasing concern over the impacts of climate change is driving countries to establish ever more ambitious GHG \nreduction targets. Approximately 200 countries, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and the members of \nthe EU have joined the Paris Agreement, an international agreement intended to provide a framework pursuant to which the \nparties to the agreement will attempt to hold the increase in global average temperatures to below 2°C above pre-industrial \nlevels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Each signatory is required to \ndevelop its own national plan to attain this objective. In December 2020, the United Kingdom announced a target to reduce \nGHG emissions 68% from the baseline year of 1990 by 2030. Canada has increased its emissions reduction target under the \nParis Agreement to 40-45% below 2005 levels by 2030, up from 30%. In April 2021, the United States increased its goal to \nreduce GHG emissions to 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030. Executive orders issued by the Biden administration, including \nin particular an executive order issued on January 27, 2021 focusing on climate change, evidence the administration’s intent to \nundertake numerous initiatives in an effort to reduce GHG emissions, including promoting renewable energy development, \nlimiting new oil and gas leases on federal lands and, in general, making climate change considerations a critical component of \nfederal policy. \nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\n10\nRegulatory Permits and Approvals\nWe hold numerous environmental and other governmental permits and approvals authorizing operations at each of our \nfacilities. A decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed regulatory material permit or approval, \nor to revoke or substantially modify an existing material permit or approval, could have a material adverse effect on our ability \nto continue operations at the affected facility. Any future expansion of our existing operations is also predicated upon securing \nthe necessary environmental or other permits or approvals. More stringent environmental standards may impact our ability to \nobtain such permits. \nHuman Capital Resources\nOur long-term success depends on our people. We are dedicated to creating a workplace where employees are proud to \nwork and grow and where everyone feels empowered to do their best work. We do this by investing in extensive recruitment, \ntraining and professional development opportunities for our employees and fostering diversity and inclusion in our culture. \nEmployee Population. We employed approximately 2,700 employees at December 31, 2023, of which 78% were located \nin the United States, 15% in Canada, and 7% in the United Kingdom. As of December 31, 2023, 11% of our employees have \nworked for the Company more than 20 years, 20% of our employees have worked for the Company between 11 and 20 years, \n27% of our employees have worked for the Company between 6 and 10 years, and 42% of our employees have worked at the \nCompany for less than 6 years. Full-time employees represented nearly 100% of our workforce as of December 31, 2023 and \napproximately 5% were covered by collective bargaining agreements. We supplement our workforce with contractors with \nspecialized skill sets during periods of peak activity, such as during turnarounds and maintenance events.\nCulture, Inclusion and Diversity. Our core values and their underlying principles reflect our commitment to a diverse and \ninclusive culture, treating one another with respect. Across the Company, all employees complete training to learn to recognize \nand address the effects of unconscious bias by challenging assumptions; encouraging diversity of experience, opinion, and \nexpression; and supporting a workplace culture that actively strives to be more inclusive. As of December 31, 2023, \napproximately 16% of our global workforce was female and 17% of the Company’s employees in frontline managerial roles \nwere female. Underrepresented groups account for approximately 18% of the Company’s U.S. workforce and 17% of our U.S. \nemployees in managerial roles. In order to continue to improve the inclusiveness and diversity of our company and culture, our \ncomprehensive Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) goals announced in 2020 include goals to increase the \nrepresentation of females and persons of color in senior leadership roles and to implement a program designed to increase the \nhiring and promotion of minority and female candidates. As of December 31, 2023, we had exceeded our representation goal \nwith approximately 37% of senior leadership roles held by females and persons of color.\nWorkforce Health and Safety. Operating in a safe and responsible manner is a core value and an integral part of what sets \nthe Company apart. We believe that focusing on leading indicators — such as the behavioral safety practices we have \nincorporated into our annual incentive plan — to drive and measure activities that prevent safety incidents, results in our \nindustry-leading safety record. As of December 31, 2023, our employee 12-month rolling average recordable incident rate \n(RIR) was 0.36 incidents per 200,000 work hours, and during the year ended December 31, 2023, our total recordable injury \ncount was ten. For the year ended December 31, 2023, our days away, restricted or transferred (DART) incident rate was 0.11 \ninjuries per 200,000 work hours, and our lost time incident rate was 0.04 injuries per 200,000 work hours. \nTalent Development. A core aspect of our culture is our commitment to identifying and developing talent to help \nemployees accelerate growth and achieve their career goals. We invest in extensive assessment, training and professional \ndevelopment opportunities for our employees through a robust set of formal and informal programs, including targeted job \nmovements, key experiences, and training, with an emphasis on creating a culture of inclusion. Leadership is the quality that \ndrives our values and sets us apart. To help foster leadership, we have developed a set of leadership competencies that provide a \ncommon language for how to demonstrate leadership at every level of the organization and have embedded them into all talent \nmanagement processes, including selection, performance management and succession planning. We view training and \ndevelopment programs as being a key part of talent management, allowing us to grow a stronger company today and in the \nfuture.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\n11\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, you should carefully consider the \nfactors discussed below before deciding to invest in any of our securities. These risks and uncertainties, individually or in \ncombination, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \nReferences to tons refer to short tons and references to tonnes refer to metric tons.\nMarket Risks\nOur business is cyclical, resulting in periods of industry oversupply during which our business, financial condition, \nresults of operations and cash flows tend to be negatively affected.\nHistorically, selling prices for our products, which are generally global commodities, have fluctuated in response to \nperiodic changes in supply and demand conditions. Demand for nitrogen is affected by planted acreage, crop selection and \nfertilizer application rates, driven by population growth, gross domestic product growth, changes in dietary habits and non-food \nuse of crops, such as production of ethanol and other biofuels among other things. Demand also includes industrial uses of \nnitrogen, for example chemical manufacturing and emissions reductants such as diesel exhaust fluid (DEF). Supply is affected \nprimarily by available production capacity and operating rates, raw material costs and availability, energy prices, government \npolicies and global trade. \nPeriods of strong demand, high capacity utilization and increasing operating margins tend to stimulate global investment \nin production capacity. In the past, nitrogen manufacturers, including CF Holdings, have built new production facilities or \nexpanded capacity of existing production assets, or announced plans to do so. The construction of new nitrogen manufacturing \ncapacity in the industry, plus improvements to increase output from the existing production assets, increase nitrogen supply \navailability and affect the balance of supply and demand and nitrogen selling prices. In certain years, global nitrogen capacity \nhas increased faster than global nitrogen demand, creating a surplus of global nitrogen capacity, which has led to lower nitrogen \nselling prices. For example, in the two-year period ended December 31, 2017, additional production capacity came online and, \nat the same time, the average selling price for our products declined 34%, from $314 per ton in 2015 to $207 per ton in 2017.\nAdditional nitrogen production capacity is expected to come online over the next 12 months outside of North America. In \naddition, plans for building new facilities for green and low-carbon ammonia have been announced by other companies and CF \nHoldings, such as our proposed plans for an export-oriented greenfield low-carbon ammonia production facility in the \nsoutheastern United States. We cannot predict the impact of this additional capacity on nitrogen selling prices. Also, global or \nlocal economic, political and financial conditions or changes in such conditions, or other factors, may cause acceleration of \nannounced and/or ongoing projects. Similarly, lower energy prices can spur increases in production in high cost regions, which \nwould result in increased supply and pressure on selling prices. Additionally, if imports increase into an oversupplied region, \nlower prices in that region could result. \nDuring periods of industry oversupply, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows tend to be affected \nnegatively as the price at which we sell our products typically declines, resulting in possible reduced profit margins, write\x02downs in the value of our inventory and temporary or permanent curtailments of production. From time to time, we have \nexperienced periods of industry oversupply, which impacted our financial performance, credit ratings and the trading price for \nour common stock. Due to the cyclical nature of our industry, we cannot predict the timing or duration of such periods of \nindustry oversupply or the degree to which oversupply conditions would impact our business, financial condition, results of \noperations and cash flows. \nNitrogen products are global commodities, and we face intense global competition from other producers.\nWe are subject to intense price competition from our competitors. The nitrogen products that we produce are global \ncommodities, with little or no product differentiation, and customers make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of \ndelivered price and, to a lesser extent, customer service and product quality. As a consequence, conditions in the international \nmarket for nitrogen products significantly influence our operating results. \nWe compete with many producers, including state-owned and government-subsidized entities. Some of our competitors \nhave greater total resources and are less dependent on earnings from fertilizer sales, which make them less vulnerable to \nfertilizer industry downturns and better positioned to pursue new expansion and development opportunities. Furthermore, \ncertain governments, in some cases as owners of some of our competitors, may be willing to accept lower prices and \nprofitability on their products or subsidize production inputs or consumption in order to support domestic employment or other \npolitical or social goals. Our competitive position could suffer as a result of these factors, including if we are not able to expand \nour own resources to a similar extent, either through investments in new or existing operations or through acquisitions or joint \nventures.\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\n12\nChina, the world’s largest producer and consumer of nitrogen fertilizers, currently has surplus capacity and many high\x02cost plants. As a result, the domestic nitrogen industry in China is operating at less than full capacity. In addition, the Chinese \ngovernment is currently limiting exports through a variety of measures. A number of factors could encourage China to increase \nproduct capacity utilization, including changes in Chinese government policy, devaluation of the Chinese renminbi, the \nrelaxation of Chinese environmental standards or decreases in Chinese producers’ underlying costs such as the price of Chinese \ncoal. Any resulting increase in export volume could adversely affect the balance between global supply and demand and put \ndownward pressure on global fertilizer prices, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results \nof operations and cash flows. \nFrom time to time, certain of our competitors with significant nitrogen fertilizer export capacity have benefited from non\x02market pricing of natural gas, which has resulted in significant volumes of exports to the United States. For example, the 2016 \nrevocations of U.S. antidumping measures on solid urea and fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate from Russia allowed for \nincreased imports from that country into the United States in recent years. In addition, in recent years, high volumes of urea \nammonium nitrate solution (UAN) imports from Russia and The Republic of Trinidad and Tobago (Trinidad) have negatively \naffected U.S. producers’ UAN profitability.\nWe also face competition from other fertilizer producers in the Middle East, Europe, Latin America and Africa. These \nproducers, depending on market conditions, fluctuating input prices, geographic location and freight economics, may take \nactions at times with respect to price or selling volumes that adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of \noperations and cash flows. Some of these producers also benefit from non-market or government-set rates for natural gas \npricing. Government policies in these regions may also stimulate future ammonia or hydrogen investments. Recently, many \nproposed green and low-carbon ammonia projects have been announced or considered, and future hydrogen, energy, or \nenvironmental/carbon policies may support development of additional nitrogen production in locations outside North America, \nincluding Europe, Australia, India, and the Middle East.\nIn addition, the international market for nitrogen products is influenced by such factors as currency exchange rates, \nincluding the relative value of the U.S. dollar and its impact on the cost of importing nitrogen products into the United States, \nforeign agricultural policies, the existence of, or changes in, import or foreign currency exchange barriers in certain foreign \nmarkets and the laws and policies of the markets in which we operate, including the imposition of new duties, tariffs or quotas, \nthat affect foreign trade and investment. For example, the imposition of duties, tariffs or quotas in a region can directly impact \nproduct pricing in that region, which can lead to changes in global trade flows and impact the global supply and demand \nbalance and pricing.

In December of 2021, we introduced our “Creating for Tomorrow” strategy, which is built on three\npillars; Grow, Innovate and Optimize. To grow, we focus on investing for advantaged growth in applications and\ngeographies where we have a leadership position. Our innovation pillar aims to develop innovative products and\nprocesses that enable a more sustainable future and where we believe we have a strong “right to win.” Finally,\nto optimize, we incorporate a continuous improvement mindset into everything we do. At the same time of this\nstrategy launch, we also outlined a set of 3-year corporate goals for adjusted earnings per share1 (EPS) growth\nand discretionary free cash flow1 generation. Specifically, we targeted to grow adjusted EPS1 at a compound\nannual growth rate (CAGR) of between 8%-12% and to generate cumulative discretionary free cash flow1 (DFCF)\nin excess of $1 billion from fiscal years 2022 through 2024. I am very pleased to report that we delivered at the\ntop end of the adjusted EPS1 goal range, achieving a CAGR of 12%, and generated cumulative DFCF1 of $1.2 billion\nthrough fiscal year 2024.\nThis level of performance was delivered despite a very challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape.\nThe continued war in Ukraine, heightened instability in the Middle East, and rising trade tensions with China\ncreated a very challenging backdrop. Additionally, the European economy remained very weak, and China’s\ngrowth was muted as it has struggled to shift its growth model from one driven by real estate and supply\x02side capacity investment to an economy fueled by consumption. Finally, we had to combat sharp inflationary\npressures over the last few years and the ensuing interest rate increases, which negatively impacted rate\nsensitive end-markets such as real estate and construction, and constrained consumer spending.\nOur ability to achieve our financial goals in the face of these headwinds is a testament to the resilience and\nagility of the Cabot team, the strength of our portfolio and leadership positions, and our collective commitment\nto execute against our goals. This high level of execution has been recognized in our strong total shareholder\nreturn (TSR) performance, where we exceeded the S&P 400 chemicals index and our chemical peer group by a\nwide margin over the one-year and three-year time periods ending September 30, 2024.\nIn addition to strong operational execution, we also advanced important strategic priorities in the fiscal\nyear, including the continued development of our Battery Materials product line and notable progress in our\nsustainability journey. As I look to the future, I believe we are well positioned to drive long-term growth and\ndeliver top-tier shareholder returns. Our achievements this year have set a strong foundation for future\nsuccess, underscoring our ability to navigate complexity, capitalize on emerging opportunities, and deliver\nvalue through innovation.\nA MESSAGE TO\nOUR SHAREHOLDERS\nSean D. Keohane\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n1 Non-GAAP measures. For definitions and reconciliation to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, see supplemental information for Non-GAAP\nReconciliations located at cabotcorp.com/investors under Financials.\n3\ncontinue strengthening our portfolio. Our strategic\nfocus remains on capitalizing on attractive growth\nopportunities, while adhering to a disciplined\ncapital allocation framework to drive long-term\nshareholder value.\nADVANCING THE ENERGY TRANSITION AND\nBATTERY DOMESTIC SUPPLY CHAIN\nBattery Materials remains a strategic growth area\nfor Cabot and in fiscal year 2024, we achieved an\nimportant milestone in support of our strategic\nobjectives. While close to 75% of the world’s lithium\x02ion batteries are produced in China today, we believe\nthe market for battery production will bifurcate, with\nsignificant production capacity expected to be built\nin the U.S. and Europe by the end of the decade.\nAs a result, both regions are providing substantial\ngovernment funding and support to build-out the\ndomestic supply chain and infrastructure needed to\nsupport lithium-ion battery production and the broader\ntransition to electric vehicles.\nAligned with this direction, Cabot was recently selected\nas a recipient to negotiate a $50 million grant from\nthe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to support a\nstate-of-the-art conductive additive manufacturing\nfacility in Wayne County, Michigan. This facility will\nbe an important part of the domestic U.S. supply\nchain for lithium-ion batteries, with capabilities to\nproduce battery-grade carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and\nconductive additive dispersions that are essential to\nelectric vehicle (EV) batteries.\nI believe our battery materials product portfolio\nrepresents a significant long-term growth opportunity\nfor Cabot, and this strategic investment in the U.S. and\nSTRONG FINANCIAL RESULTS\nWe generated very strong financial results in fiscal\nyear 2024, with adjusted EPS1 reaching $7.06, marking\na 31% increase from the prior year. These gains\nwere driven by growth in both our Reinforcement\nMaterials and Performance Chemicals segments.\nReinforcement Materials EBIT1 increased by 11% to\n$537 million, propelled by higher volumes, favorable\npricing, improved product mix, and strong operational\nexecution. The Performance Chemicals segment\nrebounded significantly over fiscal year 2023, with\nEBIT1 up 31% to $164 million as volumes reconnected\nwith underlying demand in the second half of the year,\nresulting in higher volumes and a somewhat more\nnormalized product mix.\nThe cash flow characteristics of the Cabot portfolio\nremain very strong, and in fiscal year 2024 we\ngenerated operating cash flow of $692 million\nand discretionary free cash flow1 (DFCF) of $479\nmillion. This strong level of cash generation enabled\nthe continuation of a balanced capital allocation\nframework, comprised of investments to grow in\nadvantaged areas and return capital to shareholders.\nIn fiscal year 2024, we returned $265 million to\nshareholders through dividends and share repurchases,\nrepresenting approximately 55% of DFCF1\n. We increased\nour dividend by 8% in May, underscoring our confidence\nin our robust cash flow outlook. Our long-standing\ncommitment to the dividend, which dates back to 1968,\nreflects our dedication to delivering reliable returns to\nshareholders as we continue to grow earnings over time.\nLooking ahead, we believe we are well positioned with\na flexible balance sheet and ample cash generation\ncapacity to support further growth investments and\n"Our achievements this year have set a strong foundation for future\nsuccess, underscoring our ability to navigate complexity, capitalize\non emerging opportunities, and deliver value through innovation."\n1 Non-GAAP measures.

With our extensive portfolio of\nconductive additives for the battery industry and\nestablished commercial relationships with leading\nbattery manufacturers globally, Cabot is well-positioned\nto play a vital role in the growing demand for battery\nmaterials in the U.S.\nCOMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABILITY\nAND INNOVATION\nFiscal year 2024 was a dynamic year of progress,\nunderscoring our commitment to sustainability as a\ncornerstone of our “Creating for Tomorrow” strategy.\nWe view sustainability through two critical lenses:\noperating responsibly and enabling solutions for our\ncustomers to achieve their sustainability goals.\nIn June, we published our 2024 Sustainability Report,\nwhich highlighted our latest achievements and\nprogress toward our 2025 sustainability goals. To date,\nwe have achieved nine of our fourteen sustainability\ngoals ahead of schedule, including an impressive\nmilestone: exporting 200% of the energy we import.\nThis was made possible by leveraging the waste\nenergy from our manufacturing processes to produce\nCO2\n-free cogeneration power, a tangible example of\ncircularity that contributes to both our sustainability\ngoals and our bottom line.\nOur customers are increasingly focused on sustainable\ngrowth strategies, which presents opportunities for us\nto innovate and create new sustainable materials. This\nyear, we launched several new products, including our\nREPLASBLAK® universal circular black masterbatches\nwith certified sustainable material. These new\ninnovations are powered by EVOLVE® Sustainable\nSolutions and we expect will enable us to continue\nto deliver the high performance, quality and reliability\nthat the plastics industry requires at scale for certified\ncircular solutions. In addition, we introduced PROPEL®\nE8 — an engineered reinforcing carbon that enhances\ndurability and efficiency in EV and high-performance\ntire formulations, addressing the demand for more\nsustainable, high-performance materials.\nOur sustainability achievements have continued to\nearn external recognition. We received our fourth\nconsecutive EcoVadis platinum rating, placing us in\nthe top 1% of the basic chemical sector. Additionally,\nour E2C® DX9660 solution was awarded the Tire\nTechnology International 2024 Award for Innovation\nand Excellence, underscoring our commitment to\nadvancing sustainable tire technology.\nTogether, these accomplishments reflect our\ndeep commitment to sustainability leadership and\nour determination to create shareholder value by\nintegrating sustainability into our corporate strategy.\nWe look forward to building on this progress in the\nyears to come.\n5\nOUR STRATEGY\nCREATING FOR TOMORROW\nWe will leverage our strengths to lead in performance and sustainability—today and into the future.\nINNOVATE Developing innovative products and processes that enable a better future.\nGROW Investing for advantaged growth.\nOPTIMIZE Driving continuous improvement in everything we do.\nFUTURE OUTLOOK\nI believe that fiscal year 2025 will bring continued\nearnings growth and strong cash flow generation as\nwe continue to pursue our “Creating for Tomorrow”\nstrategy. Our portfolio of innovative materials and\nindustry expertise position us well to meet the evolving\nneeds of our customers and seize new opportunities\nin high-growth markets. Our commitment to innovation,\ncommercial and operational excellence, and disciplined\nexecution remains at the core of our daily management\npractices, enabling us to deliver sustainable value\nwhile reinforcing Cabot’s role as a trusted partner and\nindustry leader.\nThe global Cabot team is at the heart of our success,\nand I am immensely grateful to each of our employees\nfor their dedication, agility, and resilience. I also want\nto extend my appreciation to our customers, partners,\nand stakeholders for their continued trust and support.\nTogether, we are bringing to life our purpose at Cabot:\nCreating materials that improve daily life and enable a\nmore sustainable future.\n6 CABOT CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2024\nUNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION\nWashington, D.C. 20549\nForm 10-K\n☒ ANNUAL REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024\nor\n☐ TRANSITION REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934\nFor the transition period from to\nCommission File Number 1-5667\nCabot Corporation\n(Exact name of Registrant as specified in its Charter)\nDelaware 04-2271897\n(State or other jurisdiction of\nincorporation or organization)\n(I.R.S.

Our\nbusiness segments are discussed in more detail later in this section.\nOur internet address is www.cabotcorp.com. We make available free of charge on or through our website our annual reports\non Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished\npursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filing\nsuch material with, or furnishing it to, the SEC. Information appearing on our website is not a part of, and is not incorporated in, this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nReinforcement Materials\nProducts\nCarbon black is a form of elemental carbon that is manufactured from by-product feedstock streams in a highly controlled\nprocess to produce particles and aggregates of varied size, structure and surface chemistry, resulting in many different performance\ncharacteristics for a wide variety of applications. Reinforcing carbons (a class of carbon blacks manufactured by Cabot) are used to\nenhance the physical properties of the systems and applications in which they are incorporated.\nOur reinforcing carbons products are used in tires and industrial products. Reinforcing carbons have traditionally been used in\nthe tire industry as a rubber reinforcing agent to increase tread durability and are also used as a performance additive to reduce\nrolling resistance and improve traction. In industrial products such as hoses, belts, extruded profiles and molded goods, reinforcing\ncarbons are used to improve the physical performance of the product, including the product’s physical strength, fluid resistance,\nconductivity and resistivity.\nIn addition to our reinforcing carbons, we manufacture engineered elastomer composites (“E2C®”) solutions that are\ncomposites of reinforcing carbons and rubber made using our patented elastomer composites manufacturing process. These\ncomposites improve abrasion/wear resistance, reduce fatigue of rubber parts and reduce rolling resistance compared to reinforcing\ncarbons/rubber compounds made entirely by conventional rubber mix methods enabling rubber product manufacturers to reduce\nthe need to make performance trade-offs. The use of E2C®solutions enables our customers to produce better performing tires,\nincluding giant off-the-road tires and on-road commercial tires, as well as other rubber products used in high-wear applications such\nas mining. Additionally, because E2C®solutions can be integrated into current product methods without additional significant capital\ninvestment, and require fewer mixing stages, lower mixing temperatures and shorter mixing cycles than conventional products,\noperating and production costs may be reduced. E2C® is one of our focus areas for growth.\nIn fiscal 2023, we launched a new technology platform, EVOLVE® Sustainable Solutions. Our ambition under this platform is to\nwork with customers and technology partners to develop products with reliable performance and produced at industrial scale across\nthree sustainability categories: Renewable, Recovered and Reduced, meaning products made with renewable materials or materials\nrecovered from end-of-life tires and/or using processes that result in reduced greenhouse gas emissions.\nDrivers of Demand and Sales and Customers\nDemand for our Reinforcement Materials products is largely driven by the growth and development of the tire and\nautomotive industries. In addition to general global economic conditions, demand for reinforcing carbons in tires is mainly\ninfluenced by the number of replacement and original equipment tires produced, which in turn is driven by (i) vehicle and driving\ntrends, including the number of miles driven, and the number of vehicles produced and registered, (ii) changes in supply chain\n6\ninventory levels to adapt to end-market demand, (iii) demand for high-performance tires, (iv) demand for larger tires and larger\nvehicles, such as trucks, buses, off-road vehicles used in agriculture, mining and similar vehicles, (v) demand for electric and hybrid\nvehicles, (vi) consumer and industrial spending on new vehicles and (vii) changes in regulatory requirements impacting vehicle fuel\nefficiency and tire regulations. Demand for reinforcing carbons for industrial products is mainly influenced by vehicle production and\ndesign trends, construction activity and general industrial production.\nDemand in the developed Western European, Japanese, and North American regions is mainly driven by demographic\nchanges, customers’ high-quality requirements, stringent tire regulation standards, changes in consumer preference (e.g., different\ntire sizes, model and powertrain types), and relatively stable tire replacement demand. Demand in developing markets, such as\nChina, Southeastern Asia, South America and Eastern Europe, has been mainly driven by the growing middle class, rapid\nindustrialization, infrastructure spending and car ownership trends and demand for products exported from these regions to the\nWestern markets. The growth in vehicle production, and in exports, in turn drives demand for both original equipment tires and\nreplacement tires in developing regions.\nSales of reinforcing carbons and E2C®solutions are made primarily by Cabot employees and secondarily through distributors\nand sales representatives. We typically “make and sell” in region, which, among other advantages, provides our customers a regional\nsupply chain and typically reduces transportation costs. Sales to five major tire customers represent a material portion of\nReinforcement Materials’ total net sales and operating revenues. The loss of any of these customers, or a significant reduction in\nvolumes sold to them, could have a material adverse effect on the segment until such business is replaced.\nUnder appropriate circumstances, we have entered into supply arrangements with certain customers, the typical duration of\nwhich is one year. These arrangements typically provide for sales price adjustments to account for changes in relevant feedstock\ncosts including natural gas and, in many cases, changes in other relevant costs (such as the cost of CO2 credits in Europe, vendor\nfinancing and product delivery). In fiscal 2024, approximately two-thirds of our reinforcing carbons volume was sold under these\nsupply arrangements. The majority of the volumes sold under these arrangements are sold to customers in the Americas and\nEurope.\nMuch of the reinforcing carbons we sell is used in tires and automotive products and, therefore, our financial results may be\naffected by the cyclical nature of the automotive industry. However, the majority of the market for our products is in replacement\ntires that historically has been less cyclical as demand for replacement tires is correlated to miles driven.\nCompetition\nWe are one of the leading manufacturers of carbon black in the world. We compete in the sale of reinforcing carbons with four\ncompanies that operate globally and numerous other companies that operate regionally, a number of which export product outside\ntheir region of manufacture. We also compete with substitute products, specifically precipitated silica, and products marketed as\nbeing made with more sustainable material, specifically reclaimed carbon, sometimes referred to as recovered carbon\nblack. Competition for our Reinforcement Materials products is based on product performance, quality, reliability, price, service,\ntechnical innovation, sustainability performance, and logistics. We believe our product differentiation, technological leadership,\nglobal manufacturing presence, operations and logistics excellence, sustainability performance, and customer service provide us\nwith a competitive advantage.\nRaw Materials\nThe principal raw material used in the manufacture of our reinforcing carbons is composed of by-product residual heavy oils\nderived from petroleum refining operations, the distillation of coal tars, and the production of ethylene throughout the world. This\n"feedstock" is not made-for-purpose, but is a by-product stream of other industrial processes and would generally otherwise be\nconsumed as a fuel oil and burned for heat or power. Natural gas is also used as a feedstock in the production of our reinforcing\ncarbons. Our manufacturing process also requires water and electricity. Raw materials are, in general, readily available and in\nadequate supply. Raw material costs generally are influenced by the availability of various types of our feedstocks, supply and\ndemand of such raw materials and related transportation costs.\nOperations\nWe own, or have a controlling interest in, and operate plants that produce reinforcing carbons in Argentina, Brazil, Canada,\nChina, Colombia, the Czech Republic, France, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands and the U.S. An equity affiliate\noperates a reinforcing carbons plant in Venezuela. In addition, we have a 98% ownership interest in an entity that manufactures our\nE2C® products in Port Dickson, Malaysia.\n7\nThe following table shows our ownership interest as of September 30, 2024 in operations in which we own less than 100%:\nLocation Percentage Interest\nShanghai, China 70% (consolidated subsidiary)\nTianjin, China 70% (consolidated subsidiary)\nXingtai City, China 60% (consolidated subsidiary)\nValasske Mezirici (Valmez), Czech Republic 52% (consolidated subsidiary)\nCilegon, Indonesia 98% (consolidated subsidiary)\nPort Dickson, Malaysia 98% (consolidated subsidiary)\nValencia, Venezuela 49% (equity affiliate)\nIn 2024, we began an expansion project at our Cilegon, Indonesia plant to add approximately 80,000 metric tons of capacity\nfor reinforcing carbons which we anticipate becoming available in fiscal 2025.\nIn addition to carbon black, our manufacturing processes produce usable energy in the form of tailgas, as a by-product. Nine of\nour reinforcing carbons manufacturing sites and four reinforcing carbons/specialty carbons manufacturing sites have energy centers,\nand we are currently installing an energy center at our reinforcing carbons plant in Ville Platte, Louisiana. These energy centers allow\nus to utilize the tailgas through some form of energy co-generation, such as steam or electricity. We can use this co-generated\nenergy internally to reduce our manufacturing operating costs, or sell it and generate revenues from these energy center\noperations.\nPerformance Chemicals\nIn Performance Chemicals, we design, manufacture and sell materials that deliver performance in a broad range of customer\napplications across the automotive, construction, infrastructure, inkjet printing, electronics, and consumer products sectors and in\napplications related to the generation, transmission and storage of energy. In this reporting segment we combine our specialty\ncarbons, specialty compounds, battery materials, fumed metal oxides, aerogel and inkjet product lines. Our focus areas for growth\ninclude conductive additives and other materials for battery applications, and inkjet dispersions for post print corrugated packaging\napplications. The recent investments we have made for growth in this segment, including in respect of these specific areas of focus,\nare described below under the heading “Operations”.\nProducts\nCarbon black is a form of elemental carbon that is manufactured in a highly controlled process to produce particles and\naggregates of varied structure and surface chemistry, resulting in many different performance characteristics for a wide variety of\napplications.\nOur specialty carbons are used to impart color, provide rheology control, enhance conductivity and static charge control,\nprovide UV protection, enhance mechanical properties, and provide formulation flexibility through surface treatment. These\nspecialty carbon products are used in a wide variety of applications, such as plastics, which applications represent the largest use for\nour products, inks, coatings, adhesives, toners, batteries, and displays.\nOur masterbatch and conductive compound products, which we refer to as “specialty compounds”, are formulations derived\nfrom specialty carbons mixed with polymers and other additives. These products are generally used by plastic resin producers and\nconverters in applications for the automotive, industrial, packaging, infrastructure, agriculture, consumer products, and electronics\nindustries. As an alternative to directly mixing specialty carbon blacks, these formulations offer greater ease of handling and help\ncustomers achieve their desired levels of dispersion and color and manage the addition of small doses of additives. In addition, our\nelectrically conductive compound products generally are used to help ensure uniform conductive performance and reduce risks\nassociated with electrostatic discharge in plastics applications.\nOur battery materials products include our conductive additives and fumed alumina, which are used principally in advanced\nlead acid and lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles. Our conductive additives consist of conductive carbons, carbon\nnanotubes and carbon nano structures, and blends of these materials, each of which offers different levels of conductivity and\nformulation flexibility for battery manufacturers to address performance (energy density, fast charging), cost and safety. In lithium\x02ion batteries, our conductive additives are used in both cathode and anode applications to increase energy density by providing a\nconductive network between active materials. Fumed alumina is used to reduce cathode material and electrolyte decomposition\nand improve capacity retention leading to longer battery cycle life.\nFumed silica is an ultra-fine, high-purity particle used as a reinforcing, thickening, abrasive, thixotropic, suspending or anti\x02caking agent in a wide variety of products for the automotive, construction, microelectronics, batteries and consumer products\nindustries. These products include adhesives, sealants, cosmetics, batteries, inks, toners, silicone elastomers, coatings, polishing\n8\nslurries and pharmaceuticals. In addition to its battery applications discussed above, fumed alumina, also an ultra-fine, high-purity\nparticle, is used as an abrasive, absorbent or barrier agent in a variety of products, such as inkjet media, lighting, coatings, cosmetics\nand polishing slurries.\nAerogel is a hydrophobic, silica-based particle with a high surface area that is used in a variety of thermal insulation and\nspecialty chemical applications. In the building and construction industry, the product is used in insulative sprayable plasters and\ncomposite building products, as well as translucent skylight, window, wall and roof systems for insulating eco-daylighting\napplications. In the specialty chemicals industry, the product is used to provide matte finishing, insulating and thickening properties\nfor use in a variety of applications including thermal runaway management for lithium-ion batteries.\nOur inkjet colorants are high-quality pigment-based black and color dispersions and inks. Our dispersions are based on our\npatented pigment surface modification technology and polymer encapsulation technology. The dispersions are used in aqueous\ninkjet inks to impart color, sharp print characteristics and durability, while maintaining high printhead reliability. These products are\nused in various inkjet printing applications, including traditional work-from-home and corporate office settings, and, increasingly, in\ncommercial and corrugated packaging, all of which require a high level of dispersibility and colloidal stability. Our inkjet inks, which\nutilize our pigment-based colorant dispersions, are used in the commercial printing segment for graphic arts.\nDrivers of Demand and Sales and Customers\nOur specialty carbons products have a wide variety of end-uses and demand is largely driven by the growth and development\nof the construction and infrastructure, automotive, electronics and consumer products industries. Demand for our conductive\nadditives for use in batteries is largely driven by the trend in electrification of vehicles. Demand for fumed silica is mainly influenced\nby trends in key markets for silicones, adhesives and coatings applications, notably, structural adhesives for automobile light\x02weighting, epoxy bonding paste for wind turbines, high-performance coatings and hybrid sealants for construction and silicones for\nmedical devices and the proliferation of electronics. Demand for specialty compounds is mainly influenced by growth and\ndevelopment of the automotive, infrastructure, consumer goods and electronic devices, packaging and agriculture industries.\nDemand for our inkjet colorants is mainly influenced by developments in print media, pages printed in office and work-from\x02home environments, as well as press sales and utilization levels as digital aqueous pigment-based inks penetrate commercial and\npackaging applications historically served by analog printing methods.\nSales of these products are made by Cabot employees and through distributors and sales representatives. In our specialty\ncarbons and specialty compounds product lines, sales are generally to a broad number of customers. In our fumed metal oxides\nproduct line, sales under contracts with five customers account for approximately one-third of the revenue. In our battery materials\nproduct line, sales to three customers account for approximately 50% of revenue.\nCompetition\nWe are a leading producer of the products we sell in this segment. We compete in the sale of carbon black with three\ncompanies that operate globally and numerous other companies that operate regionally, a number of which export product outside\ntheir region of manufacture. For battery applications, we compete primarily with two global companies that manufacture\nconductive carbons as well as a number of regional manufacturers. For carbon nanotubes, we compete primarily with one Chinese\x02based company as well as a number of regional manufacturers. We compete primarily with one manufacturer of fumed alumina that\noperates globally. For fumed silica, we compete with two companies with a global presence and several other companies that have a\nregional presence. For aerogel, we compete globally principally with one other company that produces aerogel products. We also\ncompete with non-aerogel insulation products manufactured by regional companies throughout the world. For specialty\ncompounds, we compete with many regional companies and a small number of global companies. Our inkjet colorants and inks are\ndesigned to replace traditional pigment dispersions and dyes used in inkjet printing applications. Competitive products for inkjet\ncolorants are organic dyes and other dispersed pigments manufactured and marketed by large chemical companies and small\nindependent producers.\nCompetition for our Performance Chemicals products is based on product performance, quality, reliability, service, technical\ninnovation and price. We believe our product differentiation, technological leadership, operations excellence and customer service\nprovide us with a competitive advantage.\n9\nRaw Materials\nRaw materials for our products are, in general, readily available and in adequate supply. The principal raw material used in the\nmanufacture of our specialty carbons and conductive additives is composed of residual heavy oils derived from petroleum refining\noperations, the distillation of coal tars, and the production of ethylene throughout the world. Natural gas is also used in the\nproduction of our specialty carbons. As product purity is one of the most critical requirements for conductive carbons, we obtain raw\nmaterials for those products from select key suppliers. Our raw material costs generally are influenced by the availability of various\ntypes of our feedstocks and natural gas, supply and demand of such raw materials and related transportation costs. Our\nmanufacturing processes also require water and electricity.\nThe primary raw materials for our carbon nanotubes are catalysts that we synthesize and propylene. Raw materials for the\nproduction of fumed silica are various chlorosilane feedstocks. We purchase feedstocks and for certain customers convert their\nfeedstock to product on a fee-basis (so called “toll conversion”). We also purchase aluminum chloride as feedstock for the\nproduction of fumed alumina. We have long-term procurement contracts or arrangements in place for the purchase of fumed silica\nfeedstock primarily from fence-line partners, which we believe will enable us to meet our raw material requirements for the\nforeseeable future. In addition, we buy some raw materials in the spot market to help ensure flexibility and minimize costs. The\nprincipal raw materials for the production of aerogel are silica sol and/or sodium silicate.\nThe primary raw materials used for our specialty compounds include carbon black, primarily sourced from our carbon black\nplants, prime and recycled thermoplastic resins and mineral fillers supplied from various sources. Raw materials for inkjet colorants\ninclude carbon black sourced from our carbon black plants, organic pigments and other treating agents available from various\nsources. Raw materials for inkjet inks include pigment dispersions, solvents and other additives.\nOperations\nWe own, or have a controlling interest in, and operate plants that produce specialty carbons primarily in China, the\nNetherlands and the U.S. We produce our conductive additives in China, and at our specialty carbon plants in the U.S. and in the\nNetherlands. We also own, or have a controlling interest in, manufacturing plants that produce fumed metal oxides in China,\nGermany, the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), and the U.S. and a manufacturing plant that produces aerogel in Frankfurt, Germany, which\nis currently idled. An equity affiliate operates a fumed metal oxides plant in India. Our specialty compounds are predominately\nproduced in facilities that we own, or have a controlling interest in, located in Belgium, Canada, China and the United Arab Emirates.\nOur inkjet colorants and inks are manufactured at our facility in the U.S.\nThe following table shows our ownership interest as of September 30, 2024 in operations in which we own less than 100%:\nLocation Percentage Interest\nTianjin, China (Specialty Carbons and Compounds business) 90% (consolidated subsidiary)\nJiangxi Province, China (Fumed Metal Oxides business) 90% (consolidated subsidiary)\nWuhai, China (Fumed Metal Oxides business) 80% (consolidated subsidiary)\nMettur Dam, India (Fumed Metal Oxides business) 50% (equity affiliate)\nCurrently, four of our reinforcing carbons/specialty carbons manufacturing sites have energy centers. These are described\nabove in the discussion of our Reinforcement Materials segment.\nOver the last several years, we have been investing for growth with a number of capacity expansion projects and other\ntransactions, particularly to increase manufacturing capacity for our specialty carbons and battery materials products. These\ninvestments include our purchase in 2022 from Tokai Carbon Group of its carbon black manufacturing facility in Tianjin, China where\nwe expect to make technical upgrades in the future to convert certain manufacturing units to allow us to produce conductive\nadditives. We intend to pace our investments in additional battery materials manufacturing capacity to meet demand.\n10\nGlobal Operations\nBoth of our segments operate globally, and a significant portion of our revenues and operating profits is derived from\noperations outside the U.S. In particular, manufacturers in China continue to be important producers of tires and products for\nautomotive applications, including more recently of batteries for electric vehicles, and since we made our initial investment in China\nin 1988, we have increased our operations in China to support increased demand for our products in China. We employ local\nmanagement teams for our operations in China, and our business model in China is predominantly to make and sell product in\x02country to established local and multi-national customers with operations in China. In fiscal 2024, sales in China across our segments\nconstituted approximately 25% of our revenues, and our property, plant and equipment located in China constituted approximately\n25% of our total property, plant and equipment as of September 30, 2024, as disclosed in Note V to our Consolidated Financial\nStatements. There are legal, operational and other risks associated with having substantial operations in China, which are more fully\ndescribed under the heading “Risk Factors” in Item 1A. If our ability to operate in China were to be constrained by legal, regulatory\nand operational risks, it could have a material negative impact on our overall operations and the value of our securities.\nPatents and Trademarks\nWe own and are a licensee of various patents, which expire at different times, covering many of our products as well as\nprocesses and product uses. Although the products made and sold under these patents and licenses are important to Cabot, the loss\nof any particular patent or license would not materially affect our business, taken as a whole. We sell our products under a variety of\ntrademarks we own and take reasonable measures to protect them. While our trademarks are important to Cabot, the loss of any\none of our trademarks would not materially affect our business, taken as a whole.\nResearch and Development\nOur products are highly versatile and meet specific performance requirements across many industries, creating opportunities\nfor innovation. In fiscal 2024, we spent approximately $63 million on technology development. Our R&D activities included those\nfocused in the areas of conductive additives, inkjet dispersions and engineered elastomer composites. We are also focused on\nprocess innovation across our product lines. We are investing in furthering our sustainability efforts across various areas in order to\nreduce waste, reduce emissions and utilize more sustainable material in our production processes.\nSeasonality\nOur businesses are generally not seasonal in nature, although we may experience some regional seasonal declines during\nholiday periods.\nHuman Capital Resources\nOur success is realized through the engagement and commitment of our people. We believe that our globally distributed\nworkforce positions us well to serve our broad customer base in the regions and geographies in which they operate. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, we had approximately 4,200 employees across our global network of office and manufacturing locations, with\n41% of our employees located in the Americas (61% of whom are in the United States), 32% in Asia Pacific (75% of whom are in\nChina), and 27% in Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”). Of this global employee population, 42% are employed in\nmanufacturing roles.\nOur Management Executive Committee (“Executive Committee”) is comprised of our CEO and his nine direct reports who,\ncollectively, have management responsibility for our businesses and regional operations, our financial, legal, safety, health,\nenvironment and sustainability, human resources, research and development, global business services and digital functions.\nOur primary human capital objectives are to attract, retain and develop the highest quality talent and ensure they feel safe,\nsupported and empowered to do their best work. Accordingly, our management team places significant focus and attention on\nmatters concerning Cabot’s workforce – particularly in the areas of employee health and safety, talent, engagement, diversity,\nretention and development, and total rewards. Our Board of Directors provides oversight of our human capital management efforts,\nwith a focus on employee engagement and development, executive succession and compensation, diversity, equity and inclusion\n(DE&I), and employee health and safety. These areas of focus are also represented in our 2025 Sustainability Goals, which include:\n• fostering an environment where employees report high levels of inclusion and support for their professional\ndevelopment;\n• increasing diverse representation in leadership and professional roles; and\n• reducing injuries and frequency of significant process safety events by 50%.\nOur Core Values & Culture\nOur deeply held values of integrity, respect, excellence and responsibility are the foundation of our company and the way we\noperate. They are the standards by which we interact with our customers, stakeholders and each other, fostering a positive working\nenvironment that inspires collaboration and innovation, and supports our focus on delivering shareholder value.\n11\nOur culture embodies our values in the way we work to provide a safe environment where every team member can contribute\nand have an impact. Our culture is based on five pillars:\n• Drive to Zero: We are committed to the health and safety of our people, the communities in which we work, and the\nenvironment. Our drive to zero pillar is our goal of achieving zero injuries at all of our facilities worldwide.\n• One Cabot: We make decisions and act in Cabot\'s best interest in a collaborative manner.\n• Renewal mindset: We challenge ourselves to think differently, learn, adapt and continuously improve our way of working\n• Accountable: We take personal ownership and accountability for our actions, performance and results.\n• Inclusive: We strive to provide a diverse, equitable and inclusive environment where everyone feels accepted and valued\nwith the opportunity to grow.\nIn fiscal 2024, we rolled out a new values and culture workshop globally to foster shared understanding and reinforce how our\nvalues and culture positively impact our daily work behaviors and performance. Our senior leaders and HR teams co-facilitated these\ninteractive sessions with our employees in over 20 sites across all regions.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I)\nIn support of our commitment to foster a diverse and inclusive environment, in fiscal 2024 we continued to use DE&I\nobjectives as factors that were considered in establishing the funding levels of our short-term incentive awards. These objectives\nwere:\n• Demonstrate improvement in the percentage of job searches in which candidates from underrepresented groups (for this\npurpose, defined as women in all regions and in the U.S. defined as women and people of color) are interviewed. Overall,\nour levels of diversity remained flat this year as compared to fiscal 2023. However, we saw progress in candidate diversity\nin the U.S. (12% improvement) and China (8% improvement), two of our larger job markets.\n• Ensure strong pay equity is maintained by putting action plans in place to address any pay inequities identified through\nour global compensation review process. As noted below, we believe that we maintained strong pay parity during the\nfiscal year.\nWith a continued focus on fostering an inclusive environment, as follow up to last fiscal year\'s inclusive leadership training, we\ndeveloped and deployed an inclusion self-assessment inventory for leaders to examine and strengthen their own local practices.\nOver 100 leaders completed the assessment and reviewed their results, working with their leadership teams to identify\nopportunities and actions to further promote inclusivity in the workplace.\nDemographic information with respect to gender representation among all Cabot employees and with respect to racial and\nethnic representation among Cabot employees located in the United States, as of September 30, 2024, is set forth in the tables\nbelow:\nGender Diversity\nMale % of total Female % of total\nTotal\nEmployees\nExecutive Committee 7 70% 3 30% 10\nManagement* 579 72% 227 28% 806\nProfessional Contributor 824 70% 351 30% 1,175\nHourly & Associate Staff 1,719 80% 441 20% 2,160\nTotal Population 3,129 75% 1,022 25% 4,151\nRacial and Ethnic Diversity\nNon-Minority % of total\nPeople of\nColor ** % of total\nTotal\nEmployees\nExecutive Committee 8 100% - 0% 8\nManagement* 232 77% 71 23% 303\nProfessional Contributor 192 80% 48 20% 240\nHourly & Associate Staff 348 73% 132 28% 480\nTotal Population 780 76% 251 24% 1,031\n* Management includes both people managers, excluding members of the Executive Committee, and senior-level individual\ncontributor roles.\n** People of Color consists of U.S. based employees who identify as a race or ethnicity other than white.\n12\nTalent Attraction, Development and Retention\nWe have numerous initiatives and programs to attract, develop and retain our talent tailored to specific employee populations\nand geographies, including leadership and executive development programs, technical training, and other skill-based training. In\nfiscal 2024, we deployed a new manufacturing leadership development program in our Asia Pacific region, focused on building the\ncapabilities and readiness of our future plant leaders. This initiative included assessments and 360-degree feedback to help build\nawareness and inform individual development plans, coaching and support from senior leaders, self-study through a learning\nplatform, peer learning and group discussions to help educate and prepare them for these future roles. We also further expanded\ninternal promotion and use of our online learning platform and made it available to all employees globally to support our leadership\ndevelopment programs, DE&I knowledge and skill building, and self-directed learning through our career development portal for\nemployees. We continue to see strong adoption and use of this platform with metrics exceeding peer benchmarks as shared by our\nplatform provider.\nEmployee Engagement\nWe believe that our continued focus on and investment in employee engagement and development continues to be well\nreceived by our employees and in fiscal 2024, we introduced the use of employee engagement "pulse" surveys to monitor results\nthroughout the year based on the insights and actions put in place based on last year\'s biennial global survey.\nWe have well-established performance management and talent development processes in which managers provide regular\nfeedback and coaching to develop employees. Throughout the year, managers and employees engage in annual objective setting,\nquarterly reviews of goal progress, performance feedback, career development discussions, and a year-end performance evaluation.\nIn addition, we regularly review talent development and succession plans for each of our functions and business segments to\nidentify and develop a pipeline of talent.\nSome of our employees in the U.S. and abroad are covered by collective bargaining or similar agreements. We have generally\npositive and productive employee relations with our employees, unions and works councils globally.\nCabot’s global voluntary turnover rate for fiscal 2024 was approximately 6.0%, which represents a decrease in the Company’s\nattrition rate relative to fiscal 2023, which was 7.3%.\nTotal Rewards\nWe strive to provide a total rewards program that enables us to attract, retain and motivate the best talent to support our\nbusinesses. Our compensation programs embrace a pay for performance philosophy and are designed to be competitive within the\nmarkets in which we compete for talent. Our pay practices reward individual and Company performance and are equitably\ndifferentiated based on role, experience, contributions, and performance. We value our employees\' efforts and reward those\ncontributions through our recognition and incentive programs. We regularly assess these practices to ensure we are market\ncompetitive in each of our geographic locations, offering what we believe is a compelling and attractive place to work.\nCabot is committed to ensuring that employees are paid fairly and without discrimination while taking into account job-related\nfactors such as responsibilities, location, work experience, education, performance, and contributions. We conduct reviews annually\nto monitor our pay practices and develop pay actions where appropriate. Our overall findings for this fiscal year continue to indicate\nthat we have strong pay parity between females and males globally as well as with under-represented groups in the United States\nacross all pay components (annual base salary, short-term incentives, and long-term incentives) for those in the same job and\nlocation.\nWe also aim to provide highly competitive benefits programs in all the locations where we operate, including meeting or\nexceeding local regulations and focusing on health and welfare, employee well-being, employee assistance program (EAP), and\nretirement savings. Examples of benefit programs we offer in the U.S. include a robust 401(k) plan that exceeds market standards in\nlevels of employer matching, expansive health benefits (including medical, dental and/or vision), life and accident insurance,\ndisability coverage, paid time off, tuition reimbursement and other voluntary benefits. We believe that our employees\' health and\nwell-being is important to Cabot’s success, and as a result, in fiscal 2024 we:\n• Introduced a healthcare initiative in the U.S., offering enhanced mental health and work-life support programs, including\nseveral therapy sessions per year that are covered by Cabot at no cost to our employees\n• Developed a comprehensive roadmap for our Asia Pacific employees, advancing local well-being initiatives\n• Offered a global movement challenge to encourage physical activity; and\n• Held well-being learning sessions in various countries designed to educate our employees on the importance of this topic\nand increase awareness of Cabot\'s available programs.\n13\nEmployee Health & Safety\nWe believe that one of our primary responsibilities as an employer is to provide a safe work environment and promote\nwellness across the workforce. Our goal is for all employees, contractors, and visitors to return home in the same condition as when\nthey arrived at work that day. As part of our “Drive to Zero” initiative, we have set a long-term goal of achieving zero injuries at our\nfacilities worldwide. We intend to achieve this ambitious objective by following a number of measures, including training employees\nin hazard recognition, ensuring procedures are established to mitigate risks and equipping supervisory personnel with the tools and\nskills required to execute our work safely. As part of this effort, members of our leadership team participate in root cause\ndeterminations and the results are shared throughout our network of operating facilities. Recognizing that it may take many years to\nachieve our Drive to Zero goal, we have established a continuous improvement goal for personal safety to achieve a 50% reduction\nin our recordable and severe injury rate from our baseline measurement in 2019 by 2025. For fiscal 2024, our Total Recordable\nIncident Rate (TRIR) based upon the number of injuries per 200,000 work hours for both employees and contractors was 0.22 and\nour Lost Time Incident Rate (LTIR) was 0.16. For comparison, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reports for chemical manufacturing an\naverage TRIR of 1.8 and LTIR of 0.6 in calendar year 2023.\nWe continue to be recognized as an American Chemistry Counsel Responsible Care® company and as part of our commitment\nto Responsible Care, we remain focused on continuously improving the health and safety of our processes and products. In\naccordance with this certification, we report our safety performance metrics annually and undergo external audits regularly to\nevaluate our program, identify gaps, and undertake corrective actions as needed.\nThrough our global SHE & Sustainability Commitment, which is endorsed by our Executive Committee and adopted by our Board\nof Directors, we hold ourselves accountable to demonstrate our company values and continuously improve the way we operate. The\nSHE & Sustainability Commitment defines several important objectives for our continuous improvement in safety, including:\n• Complying with all applicable regulations;\n• Sharing complete information about the safe handling and appropriate use of our products;\n• Maintaining the safety and security of our employees, contractors and neighbors;\n• Managing our operations to minimize any impacts on our communities;\n• Exemplifying the Responsible Care® Guiding Principles;\n• Partnering with customers and suppliers to advance innovative and sustainable solutions; and\n• Improving efficiencies, reducing environmental impacts and ensuring that we are prepared for emergencies that could\noccur.\nSafety, Health, Environment and Sustainability\nIn recognition of the importance of safety, health, environment and sustainability matters to Cabot, our Board of Directors has\na Safety, Health, Environment, and Sustainability Committee. The Committee, which is comprised of independent directors, meets\nregularly and oversees our safety, health, and environmental performance, process safety, security, product stewardship,\ncommunity engagement and governmental affairs. In particular, the Committee reviews metrics, audit results, emerging trends,\noverall performance, risks and opportunity assessments and management processes related to our safety, health, environmental\nand sustainability program.\nOur ongoing operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign laws, regulations, rules, and ordinances\nrelating to safety, health, and environmental matters (“SH&E Requirements”). The SH&E Requirements to which our operations are\nsubject include requirements to obtain and comply with various environmental-related permits for constructing any new facilities\nand operating all of our existing facilities and for product registrations. We have expended and will continue to expend considerable\nresources to construct, maintain, operate, and improve our facilities throughout the world for safety, health and environmental\nprotection and to comply with SH&E Requirements. We spent $58 million in environmental-related capital expenditures in fiscal\n2024. We anticipate spending approximately $78 million for such matters in fiscal 2025. These costs include costs associated with\nour compliance with the Consent Decree we entered into in November 2013 with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”)\nand the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (“LDEQ”) regarding Cabot’s three carbon black manufacturing facilities in\nthe U.S., and a significant portion of our anticipated capital expenditures for fiscal 2025 will continue to be for the installation of air\npollution control equipment at our third and final plant in Ville Platte, Louisiana. This settlement is related to the EPA’s national\nenforcement initiative focused on the U.S. carbon black manufacturing sector alleging non-compliance with certain regulatory and\npermitting requirements under The Clean Air Act, including the New Source Review (“NSR”) construction permitting requirements.\nPursuant to this settlement, Cabot has installed technology controls for sulfur dioxide and/or nitrogen oxide at its carbon black\nplants in Pampa, Texas and Franklin, Louisiana, and is in the process of installing such technology controls at its plant in Ville Platte.\nWe are currently in discussions with the EPA and LDEQ to extend our compliance date at the Ville Platte facility to 2025 based upon\nforce majeure events primarily related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect that the total capital costs to install these technology\ncontrols will be approximately $250 million and will be incurred through mid-calendar year 2025. As of September 30, 2024, we have\nincurred $201 million to install these controls in the U.S. Operating these controls increases our plant operating costs. All carbon\n14\nblack manufacturers in the U.S. have settled with the EPA and have installed similar controls. In addition, under the Province of\nOntario Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks’ (“MECP”) Regulation 419, a new requirement for sulfur dioxide (“SO2”)\nemissions went into effect on July 1, 2023 for our reinforcing carbons plant in Sarnia, Ontario. We are out of compliance with this\nnew air standard and are in discussions with the MECP on an abatement plan regarding this requirement that we expect, in its\ncurrent form, would require the installation of air pollution controls at the plant by July 1, 2028. To date, this has not restricted our\nability to operate our reinforcing carbons plant in Sarnia as we are working with MECP on a solution. We anticipate that we will need\nto incur significant capital costs for the installation of these new SO2 emissions controls, particularly during the 24-month period\nprior to the date of installation. In addition, in the EU, the large volume inorganic chemicals BREF is currently under revision, and we\nexpect that requirements to install technology controls for sulfur dioxide and/or nitrogen oxide at the Company’s four carbon black\nfacilities in the EU may be initiated starting as early as 2028.\nAs described above, environmental agencies worldwide are increasingly implementing regulations and other requirements\nresulting in more restrictive air emission limits globally, particularly as they relate to nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide and particulate\nmatter emissions. In addition, growing concerns about climate change have led to global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (“GHG”)\nemissions with a goal of achieving net zero GHG emissions in the future, which will impact the carbon black industry and our\nbusiness as carbon dioxide is emitted from those manufacturing processes. Currently, in Europe, our four carbon black facilities are\nsubject to the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (“EU ETS”). The fourth phase of the EU ETS began in January 2021, with updated\nproduct benchmarks for our carbon black facilities. As a result of revisions to the EU ETS program following the ETS Directive reform\nadopted in May 2023 that increased the ambition of the EU ETS, the free allowances under the program will be phased out over\ntime likely resulting in increased costs to the Company due to an increased need to purchase emission credits. Further, in order for\nour carbon black plant in Botlek, the Netherlands, to retain the maximum amount of free allowances allocated to this plant\nbeginning in calendar year 2025, in June 2024 we submitted to the Dutch Emission Authorities our plan for achieving carbon\nneutrality at that plant by 2050. Our plan assumes a potential investment in carbon capture, utilization and storage technology at\nthe plant that would be installed and operational for these operations by 2050. We will continue to monitor revisions and updates\nto the EU ETS program and related reporting, including updates to the carbon black product benchmarks that will apply at the\nbeginning of calendar year 2026, and other measures that may reduce the maximum amount of free allowances allocated to our\ncarbon black plants and increase our compliance costs. In addition, we are evaluating the future potential applicability of the new\ncarbon border adjustment mechanism (“CBAM”) program in the EU as an alternative to free allowances under the EU ETS and as a\nsystem complementary to the EU ETS. Our carbon black facility in The Netherlands is also subject to The Netherlands CO2 tax, which\nis a top-up tax to the EU ETS scheme. In China, a national emissions trading program is currently in place for the power sector and is\nexpected to be expanded to apply to the cement, steel, and electrolytic aluminum sectors. We continue to monitor that program’s\nfurther implementation and expect it may apply to the carbon black industry in the future with the existing regional pilot programs\nexpected to continue to operate until the national program becomes effective. Our carbon black facility in Ontario, Canada is subject\nto the Ontario Emissions Performance Standard trading system, a transition from the federal carbon tax program and under which\nspecific transition requirements became effective on January 1, 2022. In Mexico, our carbon black facility is participating in the\nnational ETS program, a transition from the pilot program that was in effect for our plant in 2023. In other regions where we\noperate, some of our facilities are required to report their greenhouse gas emissions but are not currently subject to programs\nrequiring trading or emission controls but may be subject to limited carbon tax programs affecting fuels we purchase. We generally\nexpect to pay any incurred taxes or purchase emission credits as needed to respond to any allocation shortfalls and pass these costs\non to our customers. In addition, further air emission regulations may be adopted in the future in regions and countries where we\noperate, which could have an impact on our operations. Increasing regulatory programs associated with emissions and concerns\nregarding climate change are expected to increase our capital and operational costs in the future.\nCabot has been named as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,\nand Liability Act of 1980 (the “Superfund law”) and comparable state statutes with respect to several sites primarily associated with\nour divested businesses. (See “Legal Proceedings” in Item 3 below, and Note T in Item 8 below, under the heading “Contingencies”.)\nDuring the next several years, as remediation of various environmental sites is carried out, we expect to spend against our\nenvironmental reserve for costs associated with such remediation. As of September 30, 2024, our environmental reserve was\napproximately $5 million. Adjustments are made to the reserve based on our continuing analysis of our share of costs likely to be\nincurred at each site. Inherent uncertainties exist in these estimates due to unknown conditions at the various sites, changing\ngovernmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability, and changing technologies for handling site investigation and\nremediation. While the reserve represents our best estimate of the costs we expect to incur, the actual costs to investigate and\nremediate these sites may exceed the amounts accrued in the environmental reserve. While it is always possible that an unusual\nevent may occur with respect to a given site and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a particular period,\nwe do not believe that the costs relating to these sites, in the aggregate, are likely to have a material adverse effect on our\nconsolidated financial position. Furthermore, it is possible that we may also incur future costs relating to environmental liabilities\nnot currently known to us or as to which it is currently not possible to make an estimate.\n15\nThe International Agency for Research on Cancer (“IARC”) classifies carbon black as a Group 2B substance (known animal\ncarcinogen, possible human carcinogen). We have communicated IARC’s classification of carbon black to our customers and\nemployees and have included that information in our safety data sheets and elsewhere, as appropriate. We continue to believe that\nthe available evidence, taken as a whole, indicates that carbon black is not carcinogenic to humans, and does not present a health\nhazard when handled in accordance with good housekeeping and safe workplace practices as described in our safety data sheets.\nOur products are subject to the chemical control laws and regulatory requirements of the countries in which they are\nmanufactured or imported and distributed commercially. These laws include the regulation of chemical substances and inventories\nunder the Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”) in the U.S. and the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals\n(“REACh”) in the European Union. Manufacturers or importers of these chemical substances are required to submit specified health,\nsafety, environment, risk and use information about these substances. Under the “Evaluation” portion of the REACh framework, the\nEuropean Chemicals Agency (ECHA) and European Union Member States assess the information submitted by companies within\nregistration dossiers and testing proposals to determine whether the associated substances are safe for use. The silica substance\nevaluation was concluded in 2021, and following this, the Netherlands has proposed a STOT RE 1 classification for untreated silica\nwhich has not yet been finalized. Carbon black is scheduled for a substance review in 2026. Analogous regimes exist in other parts of\nthe world, including the UK, Turkey, China, South Korea, and Taiwan. Many of these chemical control regulations are in the process\nof a multi-year implementation period for product/substance registrations or notifications.\nAdditional requirements for nanomaterials apply to many of our existing products including carbon black, fumed silica, inkjet\npigments, fumed alumina, and advanced carbons such as carbon nano structures and carbon nanotubes. Country-specific\nnanomaterial reporting programs have been implemented in some countries and are being developed by others. In the European\nUnion, application-specific safety evaluations are ongoing for nanomaterials. Additionally, in 2022, an opinion was adopted to\nclassify a subset of multi-walled carbon nanotubes that includes a carbon nanotube grade we currently manufacture, as carcinogen\ncategory 1B and specific target organ toxicant (lung) after repeated exposure category 1 under European Union regulations. The\nopinion has not yet been published in the Adaptation to Technical Progress (ATP), which would make the classification legally\nbinding. Our carbon nanotubes are bound in a matrix or contained within conductive materials in batteries, molded parts, plastics,\ncoatings, adhesives, and sealants, and we do not believe they present a health risk to end users under normal use conditions.\nExposure to carbon nanotubes could occur in the workplace. However, we believe workplace exposures can be appropriately\nmanaged with engineering controls in place at our manufacturing facilities and the use of required personal protective equipment at\nour sites.\nA number of organizations and regulatory agencies have become increasingly focused on the issue of water scarcity, water\nconservation and water quality, particularly in certain geographic regions. We are engaged in various activities to promote water\nconservation and wastewater recycling, particularly given that some of our manufacturing processes are water intensive. The costs\nassociated with these activities are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nVarious U.S. agencies and international bodies have adopted security requirements applicable to certain manufacturing and\nindustrial facilities and marine port locations. These security-related requirements involve the preparation of security assessments\nand security plans in some cases, and in other cases the registration of certain facilities with specified governmental authorities. We\nclosely monitor all security-related regulatory developments and believe we are in compliance with all existing requirements.\nCompliance with such requirements is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to factors described elsewhere in this report, the following are important factors that could adversely affect our\nbusiness. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently\ndeem immaterial may also impair our business operations and financial results.\nIndustry Risks\nIndustry capacity utilization and competition from other specialty chemical companies may adversely impact our business.\nOur businesses are sensitive to industry capacity utilization, and pricing tends to fluctuate when capacity utilization changes\noccur, which could affect our financial performance. Further, we operate in a highly competitive marketplace. Our ability to compete\nsuccessfully depends in part upon our ability to maintain a superior technological capability and to continue to identify, develop and\ncommercialize new and innovative, high value-added products for existing and future customers. Increased competition from\nexisting or newly developed products offered by our competitors or companies whose products offer similar functionality as our\nproducts, particularly those with an improved environmental footprint, that could be substituted for our products, may negatively\naffect demand for our products. In addition, actions by our competitors could impair our ability to maintain or raise prices,\nsuccessfully enter new markets or maintain or grow our market position.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations that affect our industries impose constraints on our operations, and could threaten our\ncompetitive position and increase our operating costs, which may adversely impact our business and results of operations.\n16\nOur ongoing manufacturing operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations, rules and\nordinances relating to environmental matters, many of which provide for substantial monetary fines, civil and criminal sanctions and\npossible injunctive relief for violations. These include requirements to obtain and comply with various environmental-related and\nother permits for constructing new facilities and operating our existing facilities, as well as settlements with agencies regarding\nenvironmental matters and environmental requirements. These environmental regulatory requirements impose constraints on our\noperations and could threaten our competitive position. We have expended and will continue to expend considerable amounts to\nconstruct, maintain, operate, and improve our facilities around the world for environmental protection. In addition, the increased\nemphasis on environmental justice, which is the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all individuals and communities in\nwhich we operate, regardless of race, color, national origin, or income, with respect to the development, implementation and\nenforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies, could result in increased compliance requirements and\ncosts. Furthermore, our actual or perceived failure to adhere to these principles could harm our reputation.\nFurther, environmental agencies worldwide are increasingly implementing regulations and other requirements resulting in\nmore restrictive air emission limits globally, particularly as they relate to nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and particulate matter\nemissions. We expect complying with existing regulations and other regulatory and tax changes being proposed in regions where we\noperate, if approved, will require us to incur significant additional costs for compliance, capital improvements or possibly limit our\ncurrent or planned operations. We may not be able to offset the costs of these compliance obligations through price increases. Our\nability to implement price increases is largely influenced by competitive and economic conditions and could vary significantly\ndepending on the segment served. Such increases may not be accepted by our customers, may not be sufficient to compensate for\nincreased regulatory costs or may decrease demand for our products and our volume of sales. Further, the capital improvements\nneeded to comply with environmental requirements frequently involves the development and installation of new technologies\nwithin existing plant operations and there is a risk that these new technologies will not operate as we expect. There may be delays in\nthe start-up of these capital improvements and our ability to comply with these requirements in a timely manner. In particular, it is\npossible we will experience these issues at our plant in Sarnia in light of the complexity of the new technology we expect to install at\nthat plant.\nA description of these matters is included in the discussion under the heading “Safety, Health, Environment, and\nSustainability” in Item 1 above, and in Note T in Item 8 below under the heading “Contingencies”.\nWe may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change developments and an increased focus on\ncarbon neutrality and net zero emissions, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations, and increased\npressures and adverse publicity about potential impacts on climate change by us or other companies in our industry could harm\nour reputation.\nCarbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, is emitted in carbon black manufacturing processes. Concerns about the relationship\nbetween greenhouse gases and global climate change, and an increased focus on carbon neutrality and net zero, may result in\nadditional regulations on both national and supranational levels, to monitor, regulate, control and impose taxes on emissions of\ncarbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Climate changes include extreme weather impacts, such as changes in rainfall and in\nstorm patterns and intensities, water shortages, significantly changing sea levels and increasing atmospheric and water\ntemperatures. A number of governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to climate\nchange, including regulating greenhouse gas emissions. Specifically, in certain geographic areas, our carbon black facilities are or\nmay become subject to greenhouse gas emission trading schemes or carbon tax programs under which we may be required to pay\nany incurred taxes or purchase emission credits if our emission levels exceed our free allocation. The outcome of new legislation or\nregulation in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we operate may result in new or additional requirements and fees or\nrestrictions on certain activities. Compliance with greenhouse gas and climate change initiatives may result in additional costs to us,\nincluding, among other things, increased production costs, increased feedstock costs, additional taxes, reduced emission allowances\nor additional restrictions on production or operations. In addition, certain of our carbon black products for specialty applications\nhave higher greenhouse gas emissions than our other products, which may increase our compliance costs and make it more\nchallenging to achieve our emissions goals without technology developments. We may not be able to offset the effects of these new\nor more stringent laws and regulations and compliance costs through price increases, which could adversely affect our business and\nnegatively impact our growth. Our ability to implement price increases is largely influenced by competitive and economic conditions\nand could vary significantly depending on the segment served. Such increases may not be accepted by our customers, may not be\nsufficient to compensate for increased regulatory costs or may decrease demand for our products and our volume of sales. Any\nadopted future climate change regulations could also negatively impact our ability to compete with companies situated in areas not\nsubject to such limitations.\nFurthermore, the potential impact of climate change and related regulation on our feedstock suppliers and customers is highly\nuncertain and there can be no assurance that it will not have an adverse effect on the availability, over time, of our traditional\ncarbon black feedstocks, our customers’ businesses and sourcing arrangements, and on our financial condition and results of\noperations. For instance, lower demand for oil refinery products may reduce the availability and increase the cost of certain of the\n17\nkey raw materials we use. In addition, many of our tire customers have set sustainability goals for the 2030 to 2050 time period to\npurchase more sustainable raw materials, including reduced use of fossil-derived materials, which could reduce demand for our\ntraditional carbon black products.\nIn addition, even without increased regulation, increased public awareness and adverse publicity about potential impacts on\nclimate change or environmental harm from us or our industry could harm our reputation or otherwise impact the Company\nadversely. In recent years, investors have also begun to show increased interest in sustainability and climate change as it relates to\ntheir investment decisions. Our failure to execute our sustainability strategy in a way that adequately responds to these\nenvironmental concerns in a timely manner could harm our reputation and negatively impact the perceived value of our securities.\nIn addition, new disclosure requirements related to GHG emissions and climate change, including the European Sustainability\nReporting Standards, any final rules approved by the SEC and upheld by the courts, and state laws requiring climate disclosure, may\nnegatively impact our business by diverting resources, increasing our compliance costs and harming our reputation. Further,\nincreasing weather-related impacts on our operations and plant sites may impact the cost or availability of insurance.\nWe cannot predict how legal, regulatory and social responses to concerns about climate change, as well as other sustainability\nand environmental matters, will impact our business.\nVolatility in the price and availability of raw materials and energy could impact our margins and working capital and our revenues\nfrom our energy center operations.\nOur manufacturing processes consume significant amounts of energy and raw materials, the costs of which are subject to\nworldwide supply and demand as well as other factors beyond our control. Our carbon black businesses use a variety of feedstocks\nas raw material including high sulfur fuel oils, low sulfur fuel oils, coal tar distillates, and ethylene cracker residue, the cost and\navailability of which vary, based in part on geography. Significant movements or volatility in our carbon black feedstock costs could\nhave an adverse effect on our working capital and results of operations. In addition, regulatory changes or geopolitical conflict may\nimpact the availability and prices of our raw materials. For example, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the resulting ongoing war\nhas in the past disrupted and may in the future continue to disrupt the price and availability of natural gas in Europe.\nCertain of our carbon black supply arrangements contain provisions that adjust prices to account for changes in relevant\nfeedstock and natural gas price indices. We also attempt to offset the effects of increases in raw material and energy costs through\nprice increases in our non-contract sales, productivity improvements and cost reduction efforts. Success in offsetting increased raw\nmaterial and energy costs with price increases is largely influenced by competitive and economic conditions and could vary\nsignificantly depending on the segment served. Such increases may not be accepted by our customers, may not be sufficient to\ncompensate for increased raw material and energy costs or may decrease demand for our products and our volume of sales. If we\nare not able to fully offset the effects of increased raw material or energy costs, it could have a significant impact on our financial\nresults. Rapid declines in energy prices and raw material costs can also negatively impact our financial results, as such changes can\nnegatively affect the revenues we receive from our energy centers and yield improvement investments, and may negatively impact\nour contract pricing adjustments. In addition, we use a variety of feedstock indices in our supply arrangements to adjust our prices\nfor changes in raw materials costs. Depending on feedstock markets and our choice of feedstocks, the indices we use in our supply\narrangements may not precisely track our actual costs. This could result in an incongruity between our pricing adjustments and\nchanges in our actual feedstock costs, which can affect our net working capital and our margins. Further, the timing of the\nimplementation of any of these pricing adjustments may not precisely track our actual costs as reflected in our financial statements.\nWe obtain certain of our raw materials from selected key suppliers and certain joint venture partners. If any supplier of raw\nmaterials ceases supplying raw materials to us or is unable to meet its obligations under supply agreements with us on a timely basis\nor at an acceptable price, or at all, we may be forced to incur higher costs to obtain the necessary raw materials elsewhere.\nIn addition, our manufacturing processes require water in their operations. If climate change, manufacturing, and trends in\ndigitization and electricity demands create a mismatch between water supply and demand that makes water less available for our\noperations, there is a risk that our operations may be curtailed, particularly in situations where water for human use needs to be\nprioritized over other uses, such as manufacturing operations. These costs could increase in the future in the event of water\nshortages.\n18\nA significant adverse change in a customer or joint venture relationship or the failure of a customer or joint venture partner to\nperform its obligations under agreements with us could harm our business or cash flows.\nOur success in strengthening relationships and growing business with our largest customers and retaining their business over\nextended time periods is important to our future results. We have a group of key customers across our businesses that together\nrepresent a significant portion of our total net sales and operating revenues. The loss of any of our important customers, or a\nsignificant reduction in volumes sold to them, could adversely affect our results of operations until such business is replaced or any\ntemporary disruption ends. Further, in our Reinforcement Materials segment we enter into supply arrangements with a number of\nkey customers that typically have a duration of one year, which account for approximately two-thirds of our total reinforcing\ncarbons volumes. Our success in negotiating the price and volume terms under these arrangements could have a material effect on\nour results. In addition, a number of our operations are conducted through joint venture arrangements that operate pursuant to\nlong-term contracts, including for the supply of raw materials and the provision of other services for the joint venture operations.\nAny dispute as to the terms of these contractual arrangements or deterioration in the relationship between us and our joint venture\npartner could disrupt the operations of the joint venture, which could affect our financial results and harm our reputation. In\naddition, any deterioration in the financial condition of any of our customers that impairs our customers’ ability to make payments\nto us also could increase our uncollectible receivables and could affect our future results and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to political or country risk inherent in doing business in some countries, including China.\nSales outside of the U.S. constituted the majority of our revenues in fiscal 2024. We conduct business in several countries,\nincluding China, that have less stable legal systems and financial markets, and potentially more corrupt, or less predictable, business\nenvironments than the U.S. As set forth in Note V to our Consolidated Financial Statements, sales in China constituted approximately\n25% of our revenues in fiscal 2024 and our property, plant and equipment located in China constituted approximately 25% of our\ntotal property, plant and equipment as of September 30, 2024. Our operations outside of the U.S., including in China, expose us to\nrisks related to uncertain enforcement of laws by foreign governments as well as risks that foreign governmental entities will change\napplicable rules and regulations with minimal advance notice. These risks could result in a material change in our operations, which\ncould negatively impact the value of our securities. Additionally, our operations in some countries, including China, are subject to\nthe following risks: changes in the rate of economic growth; unsettled political or economic conditions; non-renewal of operating\npermits or licenses; possible expropriation or other governmental actions; corruption by government officials and other third\nparties; social unrest, war, terrorist activities or other armed conflict; confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies; deprivation\nof contract rights; trade regulations affecting production, pricing and marketing of products; reduced protection of intellectual\nproperty rights; restrictions or additional costs associated with repatriating cash; exchange controls; inflation; currency fluctuations\nand devaluation; political tension that could result in sanctions being imposed against our customers or suppliers in countries where\nsanctions have not been imposed in the past; the effect of global health, safety and environmental matters on economic conditions\nand market opportunities; and changes in financial policy and availability of credit.\nFor example, the Chinese government has, from time to time, curtailed manufacturing operations, with little or no notice, in\nindustrial regions out of concerns over air quality. The timing and length of these curtailments has been difficult to predict and, at\ntimes, were applied to manufacturing operations without regard to whether the operations being curtailed comply with\nenvironmental regulations in the area. Accordingly, our manufacturing operations in China have been subject to these curtailments\nin the past and may be subject to them in the future. These events could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows\nboth during and after the period of any government-imposed curtailment affecting our operations. Further, any such curtailments\non the operations at our customers’ facilities could reduce demand for our products and our volumes.\nOperational Risks\nAs a chemical manufacturing company, our operations are subject to operational risks and have the potential to cause\nenvironmental or other damage as well as personal injury, or disrupt our ability to supply our customers, any of which could\nadversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe operation of a chemical manufacturing business as well as the sale and distribution of chemical products are subject to\noperational as well as safety, health and environmental risks. For example, the production and/or processing of carbon black,\nspecialty compounds, fumed metal oxides, aerogel, carbon nanotubes and other chemicals involve the handling, transportation,\nmanufacture or use of certain substances or components that may be considered dangerous, toxic or hazardous. While we take\nprecautions to handle and transport these materials in a safe manner, if they are mishandled or released into', url='https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/16040/000119312525011978/d903538dars.pdf')][0m

### Key Insight Summary:
The current status of American tariffs is complex and multifaceted, involving various types of tariffs, economic factors, and political considerations. American tariffs are defined as taxes imposed on imported goods and services, with the aim of protecting domestic industries, generating revenue, and influencing international trade. The implementation of tariffs is influenced by economic and political factors, including trade deficits, national security, and political relationships with other countries. The real-world applications of American tariffs have significant impacts on various industries, such as manufacturing, agriculture, and technology, as well as the global economy. Common misconceptions about American tariffs, such as their sole purpose being to protect domestic jobs, have been clarified, highlighting the need for a nuanced understanding of their role in international trade.

### Final Thoughts:
The current status of American tariffs reflects a delicate balance between economic, political, and social considerations. While tariffs can provide protection for domestic industries and revenue for the government, they can also lead to trade wars, higher prices for consumers, and economic instability. It is essential to consider the scientific basis of tariffs, including their economic and political underpinnings, to consider the potential consequences of tariff implementation. Furthermore, understanding the real-world applications of American tariffs and addressing common misconceptions can help policymakers, businesses, and individuals make informed decisions about international trade and economic development.

### Implications:
The implications of American tariffs are far-reaching, affecting not only the United States but also its trading partners and the global economy. As the global trade landscape continues to evolve, it is crucial to monitor the current status of American tariffs and their impact on various industries and the economy. The findings of this report highlight the need for ongoing evaluation and adjustment of tariff policies to ensure they align with the country's economic, political, and social objectives. Additionally, the report's insights can inform strategies for businesses, policymakers, and individuals to navigate the complex world of international trade and tariffs, ultimately contributing to a more stable and prosperous global economy.[0m

Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law.\n\nPART I\n\nItem\xa01—Business\n\nCostco Wholesale Corporation and its subsidiaries (Costco or the Company) began operations in 1983, in Seattle, Washington. We are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the United States (U.S.) and Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico, Japan, the United Kingdom (U.K.), Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Costco operated 890, 861, and 838 warehouses worldwide at September\xa01, 2024, September\xa03, 2023, and August\xa028, 2022. The Company operates e-commerce sites in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia. Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, under the symbol “COST.”\n\nWe report on a 52/53-week fiscal year, consisting of thirteen four-week periods and ending on the Sunday nearest the end of August. The first three quarters consist of three periods each, and the fourth quarter consists of four periods (five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53-week year). The material seasonal impact in our operations is increased net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season. References to 2024 and 2022 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended September\xa01, 2024, and August\xa028, 2022. References to 2023 relate to the 53-week fiscal year ended September\xa03, 2023.\n\nGeneral\n\nWe operate membership warehouses and e-commerce sites based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. When combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most other retailers. We often sell inventory before we are required to pay for it, even while taking advantage of early payment discounts.\n\nWe buy most of our merchandise directly from suppliers and route it to cross-docking consolidation points (depots) or directly to our warehouses. Our depots receive large shipments from suppliers and quickly ship these goods to warehouses. This process creates freight volume and handling efficiencies, lowering costs associated with traditional multiple-step distribution channels. Our e-commerce operations ship merchandise through our depots and logistics operations, as well as through drop-ship and other delivery arrangements with our suppliers.\n\n3\n\n* * *\n\n[Table of Contents](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_7)\n\nOur average warehouse space is approximately 147,000 square feet, with newer units being slightly larger. Floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space, the handling of merchandise, and the control of inventory. Because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of merchandise and low prices, our warehouses are not elaborate. By strictly controlling the entrances and exits and using a membership format, we believe our inventory losses (shrinkage) are well below those of typical retail operations.\n\nOur warehouses on average operate on a seven-day, 70-hour week. Gasoline operations generally have extended hours. Because the hours of operation are shorter than many other retailers, and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehouse-type operation, we believe labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales. Merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities, reducing labor required. In general, with variations by country, our warehouses accept certain credit cards, including Costco co-branded cards, debit cards, cash and checks, Executive member 2% reward certificates, co-brand cardholder rebates, and our proprietary stored-value card (shop card).\n\nOur strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of high-quality merchandise at prices we believe are consistently lower than elsewhere. We seek to limit most items to fast-selling models, sizes, and colors. We carry less than 4,000 active stock keeping units (SKUs) per warehouse in our core warehouse business, significantly less than other broadline retailers. We average anywhere from 9,000 to 10,000 SKUs online, some of which are available in our warehouses. Many consumable products are offered for sale in case, carton, or multiple-pack quantities only.\n\nTo promote member satisfaction, we generally accept returns of merchandise. On certain electronic items, we typically have a 90-day return policy and provide, free of charge, technical support services, as well as an extended warranty. Additional third-party warranty coverage is sold on certain electronic items.\n\nWe offer merchandise and services in the following categories:\n\n■Core Merchandise Categories (or core business):\n\n•Foods and Sundries (including sundries, dry grocery, candy, cooler, freezer, deli, liquor, and tobacco)\n\n•Non-Foods (including major appliances, small electronics, health and beauty aids, hardware, lawn and garden, sporting goods, tires, toys and seasonal, office supplies, automotive, stamps, tickets, apparel, furniture, domestics, housewares, special order kiosk, and jewelry)\n\n•Fresh Foods (including meat, produce, service deli, and bakery)\n\n■Warehouse Ancillary (includes gasoline, pharmacy, optical, food court, hearing aids, and tire installation)\n\n■Other Businesses (includes e-commerce, business centers, travel, and other)\n\nWarehouse ancillary operate primarily within or next to our warehouses, encouraging members to shop more frequently. The number of warehouses with gas stations varies significantly by country, and we have no gasoline business in Korea or Sweden. We operated 719 gas stations at the end of 2024. Our gasoline business represented approximately 12% of total net sales in 2024.\n\nOur other businesses sell products and services that complement our warehouse operations. Our e-commerce operations give members convenience and a broader selection of goods and services. Net sales for e-commerce represented approximately 7% of total net sales in 2024. Digitally originated sales, which represents sales that a member initiates through a digitally enabled device, including e-commerce, business delivery, travel, and same-day grocery, represented approximately 9% of total net sales in 2024. Our business centers carry items tailored specifically for food services, convenience stores and offices, and offer walk-in shopping and deliveries. Business centers are included in our total warehouse count.\n\n4\n\n* * *\n\n[Table of Contents](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_7)\n\nCostco Travel offers vacation packages, car rentals, cruises and other travel products exclusively for Costco members (offered in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K.).\n\nWe have direct relationships with many producers of brand-name merchandise. We do not obtain a significant portion of merchandise from any one supplier. When sources of supply become unavailable, we seek alternatives. To ensure sufficient product supply for future growth, we pursue diversification in our supply-chain management and seek to expand in-country production. We also purchase and manufacture private-label merchandise, as long as quality and member demand are high and the value to our members is significant.\n\nCertain financial information for our segments and geographic areas is included in [Note 11](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_139) to the consolidated financial statements included in [Item\xa08](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_76) of this Report.\n\nMembership\n\nOur members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals; Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document. Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships include a free household card.\n\nPaid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses. The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.\n\nOur member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.\n\nOur membership was made up of the following (in thousands):\n\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| | 2024 | | 2023 | | 2022 |\n| Gold Star | 63,700 | | | 58,800 | | | 54,000 | |\n| Business, including affiliates | 12,500 | | | 12,200 | | | 11,800 | |\n| Total paid members1 | 76,200 | | | 71,000 | | | 65,800 | |\n| Household cards | 60,600 | | | 56,900 | | | 53,100 | |\n| Total cardholders | 136,800 | | | 127,900 | | | 118,900 | |\n\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n(1)Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\n\nEffective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65 per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.\n\n5\n\n* * *\n\n[Table of Contents](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_7)\n\nHuman Capital\n\n“Take Care of Our Employees,” is a key component of our code of ethics and is fundamental to our commitment to “Take Care of Our Members.” We must also carefully control our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, so that we can sell high quality goods and services at low prices. Compensation and benefits for employees is our largest expense after the cost of merchandise and is carefully monitored.\n\nEmployee Base\n\nAt the end of 2024, we employed 333,000 employees worldwide. Approximately 95% are employed in our membership warehouses and distribution channels. Approximately 5% are represented by unions. We also utilize seasonal employees.\n\nThe total number of employees by segment was:\n\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| | 2024 | | 2023 | | 2022 |\n| United States | 219,000 | | | 208,000 | | | 202,000 | |\n| Canada | 53,000 | | | 51,000 | | | 50,000 | |\n| Other International | 61,000 | | | 57,000 | | | 52,000 | |\n| Total employees | 333,000 | | | 316,000 | | | 304,000 | |\n\nGrowth and Engagement\n\nWe believe that our warehouses are among the most productive in the retail industry, owing largely to the commitment and efficiency of our employees. We seek to provide them not merely with employment but careers. Many attributes of our business contribute to the objective. The more significant include: competitive compensation and benefits; a commitment to employee development and promoting from within; and a target ratio of at least 50% of our employee base being full-time employees. These attributes contribute to what we consider, especially for the industry, a high retention rate. In 2024, in the U.S. and Canada that rate was approximately 93% for employees who have been with us for at least one year.\n\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\n\nThe commitment to “Take Care of Our Employees” includes promoting diversity, equity and inclusion and creating an inclusive and respectful workplace. We strive for an environment where all employees feel that they belong, are accepted, included, respected and supported because of whom they are individually. We demonstrate leadership commitment to equity through consistent communication, employee development and education, support of diversity and inclusion initiatives within the organization, community involvement, and supplier inclusion. Costco continues its efforts to develop future leaders, including through our supervisor in training (SIT) programs in the U.S. and Canada. In 2024, over 7,500 hourly employees completed the 6-week course.\n\nWell Being\n\nCostco strives to provide our employees with competitive wages and excellent benefits. In July 2024, we increased the starting wage to at least $19.50 for all entry-level positions in the U.S. and Canada. We also increased the top of wage scales by $1 per hour, and increased all other steps of the wage scales by $0.50 per hour, bringing our average hourly rate at the end of 2024 for hourly employees in the U.S. to approximately $31 per hour. We continue to offer expansive benefits in the U.S. that provide physical, emotional and financial well-being support for employees and their dependents at little cost to our employees. Costco remains committed to protecting the health and safety of our members and employees and to serving our communities.\n\n6\n\n* * *\n\n[Table of Contents](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_7)\n\nFor more detailed information regarding our programs and initiatives, see “Employees” within our Sustainability Commitment (located on our website). The Sustainability Commitment and other information on our website are not incorporated by reference into and do not form any part of this Annual Report.\n\nCompetition\n\nOur industry is highly competitive, based on factors such as price, merchandise quality and selection, location, convenience, distribution strategy, and customer service. We compete on a worldwide basis with global, national, and regional wholesalers and retailers, including supermarkets, supercenters, online retailers, gasoline stations, hard discounters, department and specialty stores, and operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise. Walmart, Target, Kroger, and Amazon are among our significant general merchandise retail competitors in the U.S. We also compete with other warehouse clubs, including Walmart’s Sam’s Club and BJ’s Wholesale Club in the U.S. Many of the major metropolitan areas in the U.S. and certain of our Other International locations have multiple competing clubs.\n\nIntellectual Property\n\nWe believe that, to varying degrees, our trademarks, trade names, copyrights, proprietary processes, trade secrets, trade dress, domain names and similar intellectual property add significant value to our business and are important to our success. We have invested significantly in the development and protection of our well-recognized brands, including the Costco Wholesale trademarks and our private-label brand, Kirkland Signature. We believe that Kirkland Signature products are high quality, offered at prices that are generally lower than national brands, and help lower costs, differentiate our merchandise offerings, and generally earn higher margins. We expect to continue to increase the sales penetration of our private-label items.\n\nWe rely on trademark and copyright laws, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality, license and other agreements with our suppliers, employees and others to protect our intellectual property. The availability and duration of trademark registrations vary by country; however, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and registrations are maintained.\n\nAvailable Information\n\nOur U.S. website is www.costco.com. We make available through the Investor Relations section of that site, free of charge, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, Proxy Statements and Forms 3, 4 and 5, and any amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such materials with or furnishing such documents to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The information found on our website is not part of this or any other report filed with or furnished to the SEC. The SEC maintains a site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers, such as the Company, that file electronically with the SEC at www.sec.gov.\n\nWe have a code of ethics for senior financial officers, pursuant to Section\xa0406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Copies of the code are available free of charge by writing to Secretary, Costco Wholesale Corporation, 999 Lake Drive, Issaquah, WA 98027. If the Company makes any amendments to this code (other than technical, administrative, or non-substantive amendments) or grants any waivers, including implicit waivers, to the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer or principal accounting officer and controller, we will disclose (on our website or in a Form 8-K report filed with the SEC) the nature of the amendment or waiver, its effective date, and to whom it applies.\n\n7\n\n* * *\n\n[Table of Contents](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_7)\n\nInformation about our Executive Officers\n\nThe executive officers of Costco, their position, and ages are listed below.

We could also be affected by additional risks that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally, as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial. These Risk Factors should be carefully reviewed in conjunction with Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in [Item\xa07](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_46) and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in [Item\xa08](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_76) of this Report.\n\nBusiness and Operating Risks\n\nWe are highly dependent on the financial performance of our U.S. and Canadian operations.\n\nOur financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our U.S. and Canadian operations, which comprised 86% and 85% of net sales and operating income in 2024. Within the U.S., we are highly dependent on our California operations, which comprised 27% of U.S. net sales in 2024. Our California market, in general, has a larger percentage of higher volume warehouses as compared to our other domestic markets. Any substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations could materially adversely affect our business and financial results. Declines in financial performance of our U.S. operations, particularly in California, and our Canadian operations could arise from, among other things: slow growth or declines in comparable warehouse sales (comparable sales); negative trends in operating expenses, including increased labor, healthcare and energy costs; failing to meet targets for warehouse openings; cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses; shifts in sales mix toward lower gross margin products; changes or uncertainties in economic conditions in our markets, including higher levels of unemployment and depressed home values; and failing to consistently provide high quality and innovative new products.\n\nWe may be unsuccessful implementing our growth strategy, including expanding our business in existing markets and new markets, and integrating acquisitions, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nOur growth is dependent, in part, on our ability to acquire property and build or lease new warehouses and depots. We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations. Local land use and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehouses and depots, as well as local community actions opposed to the location of our warehouses or depots at specific sites and the adoption of local laws restricting our operations and environmental regulations, may impact our ability to find suitable locations and increase the cost of sites and of constructing, leasing and operating warehouses and depots. We also may have difficulty negotiating leases or purchase agreements on acceptable terms. In addition, certain jurisdictions have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operation or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs, including us. Failure to effectively manage these and other similar factors may affect our ability to timely build or lease and operate new warehouses and depots, which could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and profitability.\n\nWe seek to expand in existing markets to attain a greater overall market share. A new warehouse may draw members away from our existing warehouses and adversely affect their comparable sales performance, member traffic, and profitability.\n\nWe intend to continue to open warehouses in new markets. Associated risks include difficulties in attracting members due to a lack of familiarity with us, attracting members of other wholesale club operators, our lesser familiarity with local member preferences, and seasonal differences in the market. Entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large, established market presence. We cannot ensure that new warehouses and new e-commerce sites will be profitable and future profitability could be delayed or otherwise materially adversely affected.\n\n9\n\n* * *\n\n[Table of Contents](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_7)\n\nWe have made and may continue to make investments and acquisitions to improve the speed, accuracy and efficiency of our supply chains and delivery channels. The effectiveness of these investments can be less predictable than opening new locations and might not provide the anticipated benefits or desired rates of return.\n\nOur failure to maintain membership growth, loyalty and brand recognition could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nMembership loyalty and growth are essential to our business. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of Executive membership, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Damage to our brands or reputation may negatively impact comparable sales, diminish member trust, and reduce renewal rates and, accordingly, net sales and membership fee revenue, negatively impacting our results of operations.\n\nWe sell many products under our Kirkland Signature brand. Maintaining consistent product quality, competitive pricing, and availability of these products is essential to developing and maintaining member loyalty. These products also generally carry higher margins than national brand products and represent a growing portion of our overall sales. If the Kirkland Signature brand experiences a loss of member acceptance or confidence, our sales and gross margin results could be adversely affected.\n\nDisruptions in merchandise distribution or processing, packaging, manufacturing, and other facilities could adversely affect sales and member satisfaction.\n\nWe depend on the orderly operation of the merchandise receiving and distribution process, primarily through our depots. We also rely upon processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items. Although we believe that our operations are efficient, disruptions due to extreme weather, pandemics or other catastrophic events, labor issues, work stoppage, or other shipping problems may result in delays in the production and delivery of merchandise to and the operation of our warehouses, which could adversely affect sales and the satisfaction of our members. Our e-commerce operations depend heavily on logistics providers, both internal and external, and are negatively affected when services are unable to be provided in a timely fashion.\n\nWe may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer tastes and preferences, which could negatively affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services, and our market share.\n\nIt is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services that our members will desire. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to identify and respond to trends in demographics and consumer preferences. Failure to identify timely or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and spending patterns including those related to resource efficiency, environmental protection, human rights, and the transition to a low-carbon economy could negatively affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. We sell a substantial amount of gasoline, the demand for which could be impacted by concerns and regulation about climate change.\n\nIf we are not successful at predicting our sales trends and adjusting our purchases accordingly, we may have excess inventory, which could result in additional markdowns, or we may experience out-of-stock positions and delivery delays, which could result in higher costs, both of which would reduce our operating performance. This could have an adverse effect on net sales, gross margin and operating income.\n\nAvailability and performance of our IT systems are vital to our business. Failure to successfully execute IT projects and have IT systems available to our business would adversely impact our operations.\n\n10\n\n* * *\n\n[Table of Contents](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_7)\n\nIT systems play a crucial role in conducting our business. These systems are utilized to process a very high volume of transactions, conduct payment transactions, track and value our inventory and produce reports critical for making business decisions. Failure or disruption of these systems could have an adverse impact on our ability to buy products and services from our suppliers, produce goods in our manufacturing plants, move the products in an efficient manner to our warehouses and sell products to our members. Given the high volume of transactions we process, it is important that we build strong digital resiliency to prevent disruption from events such as power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, viruses, internal or external security breaches and other cybersecurity incidents, errors by employees, extreme weather, and catastrophic events. Any debilitating failure of our critical IT systems, data centers and backup systems would require significant investments in resources to restore IT services and may cause serious impairment in our business operations including loss of business services, increased cost of moving merchandise and failure to provide service to our members. We are currently making substantial investments in technology and IT transformation projects, including maintaining and enhancing our digital resiliency, and failure or delay in these projects could be costly and harmful to our business. Failure to deliver IT transformation efforts efficiently and effectively could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Insufficient IT capacity could also impact our capacity for timely, complete and accurate financial and non-financial reporting required by law.\n\nWe are required to maintain the privacy and security of personal and business information amidst multiplying threat landscapes and in compliance with increasing privacy and data protection regulations globally. Failure to do so could damage our business, including our reputation with members, suppliers and employees, cause us to incur substantial additional costs, and become subject to litigation and regulatory action.\n\nIncreased security threats and more sophisticated cyber misconduct pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and services. We rely upon IT systems and networks, some of which are managed by or belong to third parties, including suppliers, partners, vendors, and service providers. Additionally, we collect, store and process sensitive information relating to our business, members, employees, and other third parties. Operating these IT systems and networks, and processing and maintaining this data, in a secure manner, is critical to our business operations and strategy. Remote work has also expanded the possible attack surfaces. Attempts to gain unauthorized access to systems, networks and data, both ours and third parties with whom we work, are increasing in frequency and sophistication, and in some cases, these attempts are successful. Cybersecurity attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks, including sophisticated computer crimes and advanced persistent threats. Phishing attacks have emerged as particularly prominent, including as vectors for ransomware attacks, which have increased in breadth and frequency. While we train our employees as part of our security efforts, that training cannot be completely effective. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data. Our IT systems and networks, or those managed by third parties such as cloud providers or suppliers that otherwise host or have access to confidential information, periodically have vulnerabilities, which may go unnoticed for a period of time. Our logging capabilities, or the logging capabilities of third parties, are also not always complete or sufficiently detailed, affecting our ability to fully investigate and understand the scope of security events. While our cybersecurity and compliance efforts seek to mitigate such risks, there can be no guarantee that the actions and controls we and our third-party service providers have implemented and are implementing, will be sufficient to protect our systems, information or other property.\n\nThe potential impacts of a cybersecurity attack include reputational damage, litigation, government enforcement actions, penalties, disruption to systems and operations, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, corruption of data, diminution in the value of our investment in IT systems and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs. This could adversely affect our competitiveness, results of operations and financial condition and, critically in light of our business model, loss of member confidence. Further, the insurance coverage we maintain and indemnification arrangements with third parties may be inadequate to cover claims, costs, and liabilities relating to\n\n11\n\n* * *\n\n[Table of Contents](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_7)\n\ncybersecurity incidents. In addition, data we collect, store and process is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations (such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, California Consumer Privacy Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and China's Personal Information Protection Act), evolving rules concerning artificial intelligence, and other privacy and cybersecurity laws and restrictions on use of member information that may also impair our ability to utilize data, consistent with member consents and preferences, which may carry significant potential penalties for noncompliance.\n\nWe are subject to payment-related risks.\n\nWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including select credit and debit cards, cash and checks, co-brand cardholder rebates, Executive member 2% reward certificates, and our shop card. As we offer new payment options to our members, we may be subject to additional rules, regulations, compliance requirements, and higher fraud losses. For certain payment methods, we pay interchange and other related acceptance fees, along with additional transaction processing fees. We rely on third parties to provide payment transaction processing services for credit and debit cards and our shop card. It could disrupt our business if these parties become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We are also subject to fee increases by these service providers.\n\nWe must comply with evolving payment card association and network operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers. For example, we are subject to Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, which contain compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage, processing and transmission of individual cardholder data. If our internal systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for card re-issuance costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept card payments from our members, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. Our failure to offer payment methods desired by our members could create a competitive disadvantage.\n\nWe might sell products that cause illness or injury to our members, harm to our reputation, and expose us to litigation.\n\nIf our merchandise, including food and prepared food products for human consumption, drugs, children's products, pet products and durable goods, do not meet or are perceived not to meet applicable safety or labeling standards or our members' expectations, we could experience lost sales, increased costs, litigation or reputational harm. The sale of these items involves the risk of illness or injury to our members. Such illnesses or injuries could result from tampering by unauthorized third parties, product contamination or spoilage, including the presence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, other agents, or residues introduced during the growing, manufacturing, storage, handling and transportation phases, or faulty design. Our suppliers are generally contractually required to comply with product safety laws, and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with safety and other standards. While we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and work to comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations, we cannot be sure that consumption or use of our products will not cause illness or injury or that we will not be subject to claims, lawsuits, or government investigations relating to such matters, resulting in costly product recalls and other liabilities that could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, negative publicity could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential members and our corporate and brand image, and these effects could be long-term.\n\nIf we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant omnichannel experience for our members, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.\n\nOmnichannel retailing is rapidly evolving, and we must keep pace with changing member expectations and new developments by our competitors. Our members are increasingly using mobile phones, tablets, computers, and other devices to shop and to interact with us through social media. We are making\n\n12\n\n* * *\n\n[Table of Contents](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_7)\n\ninvestments in our websites and mobile applications. If we are unable to make, improve, or develop relevant member-facing technology in a timely manner, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nInability to attract, train and retain highly qualified employees could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nOur success depends on the continued contributions of our employees, including members of our senior management and other key operations, IT, merchandising and administrative personnel. Failure to identify and implement a succession plan for senior management could negatively impact our business. We must attract, train and retain a large and growing number of qualified employees, while controlling related labor costs and maintaining our core values. Our ability to control labor and benefit costs is subject to numerous internal and external factors, including regulatory changes, prevailing wage rates, union relations and healthcare and other insurance costs. We compete with other retail and non-retail businesses for these employees and invest significant resources in training and motivating them. There is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe may incur property, casualty or other losses not covered by our insurance.\n\nClaims for employee health care benefits, workers’ compensation, general liability, property damage, directors’ and officers’ liability, vehicle liability, inventory loss, and other exposures are funded predominantly through self-insurance. Insurance coverage is maintained for certain risks to limit exposures arising from very large losses. The types and amounts of insurance may vary from time to time based on our decisions with respect to risk retention and regulatory requirements. Significant claims or events, regulatory changes, a substantial rise in costs of health care or costs to maintain our insurance or the failure to maintain adequate insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nAlthough we maintain specific coverages for catastrophic property losses, we still bear a significant portion of the risk of losses incurred as a result of any physical damage to, or the destruction of, any warehouses, depots, manufacturing or home office facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory, and business interruption. Such losses could materially impact our cash flows and results of operations.\n\nMarket and Other External Risks\n\nWe face strong competition from other retailers and warehouse club operators, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe retail business is highly competitive. We compete for members, employees, sites, products and services and in other important respects with a wide range of local, regional and national wholesalers and retailers, both in the United States and in foreign countries, including other warehouse-club operators, supermarkets, supercenters, online retailers, gasoline stations, hard discounters, department and specialty stores and operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise. Such retailers and warehouse club operators compete vigorously and in a variety of ways, including pricing, selection and availability, services, location, convenience, store hours, and the attractiveness and ease of use of websites and mobile applications. The evolution of retailing in online and mobile channels has improved the ability of customers to comparison shop, which has enhanced competition. Some competitors have greater financial resources and technology capabilities, including the faster adoption of artificial intelligence, better access to merchandise, and greater market penetration than we do. Our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures, changes in the retail markets or customer expectations could result in lost market share and negatively affect our financial results.\n\n13\n\n* * *\n\n[Table of Contents](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_7)\n\nGeneral economic factors, domestically and internationally, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nHigher energy and gasoline costs, inflation, levels of unemployment, healthcare costs, consumer debt levels, foreign-currency exchange rates, unsettled financial markets, weaknesses in housing and real estate markets, reduced consumer confidence, changes and uncertainties related to government fiscal, monetary and tax policies including changes in interest rates, tax rates, duties, tariffs, or other restrictions, sovereign debt crises, pandemics and other health crises, and other economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services, require a change in product mix, or impact the cost of or ability to purchase inventory. Additionally, trade-related actions in various countries, particularly China and the United States, have affected the costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. The impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to potential cost increases. Higher tariffs could adversely impact our results.\n\nPrices of certain commodities, including gasoline and consumable goods used in manufacturing and our warehouse retail operations, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, inflationary pressures, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations, taxes and periodic delays in delivery. Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices and our ability and desire to pass them through to our members may affect our sales and profit margins. These factors could also increase our merchandise costs and selling, general and administrative expenses, and otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial results. General economic conditions can also be affected by events like the outbreak of hostilities or acts of terrorism.\n\nInflationary factors such as increases in merchandise costs may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to adjust prices to sufficiently offset the effect of cost increases without negatively impacting consumer demand.\n\nSuppliers may be unable to timely supply us with quality merchandise at competitive prices or may fail to adhere to our high standards, resulting in adverse effects on our business, merchandise inventories, sales, and profit margins.\n\nWe depend heavily on our ability to purchase quality merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. As the quantities we require continue to grow, we have no assurances of continued supply, appropriate pricing or access to new products, and any supplier has the ability to change the terms upon which they sell to us or discontinue selling to us. Member demands may lead to out-of-stock positions causing a loss of sales and profits.\n\nWe buy from numerous domestic and foreign suppliers and importers. Our inability to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or the loss of key suppliers could negatively affect us. We may not be able to develop relationships with new suppliers, and products from alternative sources, if any, may be of a lesser quality or more expensive. Because of our efforts to adhere to high-quality standards for which available supply may be limited, particularly for certain food items, the large volumes we demand may not be consistently available. Our efforts to secure supply could lead to commitments that prove to be unsuccessful in the short and long-term.\n\nOur suppliers (and those they depend upon for materials and services) are subject to risks, including labor disputes, union organizing activities, human and animal rights violations, financial liquidity, climate change, natural disasters, extreme weather conditions, environmental degradation, public health emergencies, supply constraints and general economic and political conditions and other risks similar to those we face that could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable merchandise. One or more of our suppliers might not adhere to our quality control, packaging, legal, regulatory, labor, human rights, environmental or animal welfare standards. These deficiencies may delay or preclude delivery of merchandise to us and might not be identified before we sell such merchandise to our members. This\n\n14\n\n* * *\n\n[Table of Contents](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_7)\n\nfailure could lead to recalls and litigation and otherwise damage our reputation and our brands, increase costs, and otherwise adversely impact our business.\n\nFluctuations in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nDuring 2024, our international operations, including Canada, generated 28% and 33% of our net sales and operating income. Our international operations have accounted for an increasing portion of our warehouses, and we plan to continue international growth. To prepare our consolidated financial statements, we translate the financial statements of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates. Future fluctuations in exchange rates that are unfavorable to us may adversely affect the financial performance of our Canadian and Other International operations and have a corresponding adverse period-over-period effect on our results of operations. As we continue to expand internationally, our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may increase.\n\nA portion of the products we purchase is paid for in a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods are sold. Currency fluctuations may increase our merchandise costs and may not be passed on to members and thus may adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nNatural disasters, extreme weather conditions, or other catastrophic events could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nNatural disasters and extreme weather conditions, including those impacted by climate change, such as extreme temperatures, hurricanes, typhoons, floods, earthquakes, wildfires, droughts; acts of terrorism or violence, including active shooter situations; and energy shortages; particularly in California or Washington state, where our centralized operating systems and administrative personnel are located, could negatively affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to our properties, additional heating, cooling, and refrigeration costs, limitations on store operating hours, less frequent visits by members to physical locations, the temporary closure of warehouses, depots, manufacturing or home office facilities, the temporary lack of an adequate work force, disruptions to our IT systems, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some local or overseas suppliers, the temporary disruption in the transport of goods to or from overseas, damage to buildings or inventory, delays in the delivery of goods to our warehouses or depots, the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our warehouses, and long-term disruption or threats to the habitability of key markets in which we operate. These events could also reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible to procure products. We may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nPandemics and other health crises could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in many respects.\n\nThe emergence, severity, magnitude and duration of global or regional health crises are uncertain and difficult to predict. A pandemic could affect certain business operations, demand for our products and services, in-stock positions, costs of doing business, availability of labor, access to inventory, supply chain operations, our ability to predict future performance, exposure to litigation, and our financial performance, among other things. Other factors and uncertainties include, but are not limited to:\n\n•The severity and duration of pandemics;\n\n•Evolving macroeconomic factors, including general economic uncertainty, unemployment rates, and recessionary pressures;\n\n•Changes in labor markets affecting us and our suppliers;\n\n•Unknown consequences on our business performance and initiatives stemming from the substantial investment of time and other resources to the pandemic response;\n\n•The pace of post-pandemic recovery;\n\n•The long-term impact of the pandemic on our business, including consumer behaviors; and\n\n•Disruption and volatility within the financial and credit markets.\n\n15\n\n* * *\n\n[Table of Contents](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_7)\n\nFailure to meet financial market expectations could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.\n\nWe believe that the price of our stock currently reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations, including our warehouse and e-commerce comparable sales growth rates, membership renewal rates, new member sign-ups, gross margin, earnings, earnings per share, new warehouse openings, or dividend or stock repurchase policies could cause the price of our stock to decline.\n\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\n\nWe are subject to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political and economic factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nAt the end of 2024, we operated 276 warehouses outside of the U.S. (31% of all warehouse locations), and we plan to continue expanding our international operations. Future operating results internationally could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, many similar to those we face in the U.S., certain of which are beyond our control. These factors include political and economic conditions, regulatory constraints, currency regulations, policy changes, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future. Other factors that may impact international operations include foreign trade (including tariffs and trade sanctions), monetary and fiscal policies and the laws and regulations of the U.S. and foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having major facilities in locations which have been historically less stable than the U.S. Risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences, and difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights. New reporting obligations globally are increasing the cost and complexity of doing business.\n\nChanges in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nAccounting principles and related pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations we apply to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, including self-insurance liabilities, are highly complex and involve subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by our management. Changes in rules or interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance and have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe are exposed to risks relating to evaluations of controls required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and otherwise.\n\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires management assessments of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures, our ability to record, process and report financial information accurately and to prepare financial statements within required time periods could be adversely affected, which could subject us to litigation or investigations requiring management resources and payment of legal and other expenses, negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements and adversely impact our stock price. Uncertainties around our developing systems concerning controls for non-financial reporting also create risks.\n\nChanges in tax rates, new U.S. or foreign tax legislation, and exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection and remittance obligations in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Additionally, at any point in time, we may be under examination for value\n\n16\n\n* * *\n\n[Table of Contents](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_7)\n\nadded, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes. We may recognize additional tax expense, be subject to additional tax liabilities, or incur losses and penalties, due to changes in laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, assessments by authorities and interpretations related to tax, including tax rules in various jurisdictions. We compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the countries in which we operate. As tax rates vary among countries, a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision. Additionally, changes in the enacted tax rates or adverse outcomes in tax audits, including transfer pricing disputes, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nChanges in or failure to comply with environmental, social, or governance (ESG) regulations could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe are subject to a wide and increasingly broad array of laws and regulations globally relating to ESG matters, including disclosure and compliance requirements. These laws and regulations, along with expanding voluntary reporting, are expanding the scope and complexity of matters that we are required to regulate, assess, and disclose and potentially limit our sourcing flexibility. Failure to comply with these laws could result in harm to our members, employees, workers in the value chain or others, significant costs to satisfy environmental compliance, remediation or compensatory requirements, or the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations by governmental agencies or courts that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nOperations at our facilities require the treatment and disposal of wastewater, stormwater and agricultural and food processing wastes, the use and maintenance of refrigeration systems, including ammonia-based chillers, noise, odor and dust management, the operation of mechanized processing equipment, and other operations that potentially could affect the environment and public health and safety. Failure to comply with current and future environmental, health and safety standards could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, illness or injury of our employees, and claims or lawsuits related to such illnesses or injuries, and temporary closures or limits on the operations of facilities.\n\nNatural gas, diesel fuel, gasoline, and electricity are used in our operations, distribution channels, and value chain. Government regulations limiting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental restrictions may increase compliance, operations, and merchandise costs, and other regulations affecting energy inputs could materially affect our profitability.\n\nMore stringent fuel economy standards, changing public policies aimed at increasing the adoption of zero-emission and alternative fuel vehicles, and other regulations related to climate change may affect our future operations, adversely impact certain elements of our profitability, and require significant capital expenditures.\n\nFailure or perceived failure to meet our ESG goals or expectations set by growing public interest and government regulation of ESG topics could result in reputational harm or adversely affect our business\n\nCostco has set public targets and disclosed intentions for future action regarding sustainability. There are dependencies outside of our control impacting our ability to meet our goals, including but not limited to: economic conditions, ability to access technology at an appropriate cost or scale, the ability to procure sufficient clean energy at competitive market rates to meet future operational and supplier needs, unforeseen operational and implementation challenges, termination or contraction of policies or systems which support our capital investments, and collaboration with third parties. We may not make adequate and timely investments or successfully implement strategies that will effectively achieve our sustainability-related goals, which could lead to reputational harm with members and other stakeholders.\n\n17\n\n* * *\n\n[Table of Contents](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_7)\n\nWe are involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits and some of these outcomes could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nOur business requires compliance with many laws and regulations. Failure to achieve compliance could subject us to lawsuits and other proceedings and lead to damage awards, fines, penalties, and remediation costs. We are or may become involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits, including grand jury investigations, government and agency investigations, and consumer, employment, tort, unclaimed property laws, and other litigation. We cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these proceedings and other contingencies, including environmental remediation and other proceedings commenced by governmental authorities. The outcome of some of these proceedings, audits, unclaimed property laws, and other contingencies could require us to take, or refrain from taking, actions which could negatively affect our operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money, adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management's attention and resources.\n\nItem\xa01B—Unresolved Staff Comments\n\nNone.\n\nItem\xa01C—Cybersecurity\n\nRisk Management and Global Strategy\n\nWe have implemented processes, technologies, and controls to seek to assess, identify, and manage risks associated with cybersecurity threats. Management considers cybersecurity risks within our overall approach to enterprise risk management. We evaluate these risks based on several frameworks, including the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), Center for Internet Security (CIS) 18 Critical Security Controls, and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). Our governance policies, including our Information Security Policy, outline high-level objectives designed to meet compliance and regulatory requirements.\n\nWe undertake a bi-annual NIST CSF and CIS 18 Critical Security Controls assessment, conducted by a third-party, to measure our program maturity. We have implemented a variety of technologies, leveraging third-party security providers for some, and engage in multiple activities to seek to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities and risks in systems. These include, among other activities, scanning for common vulnerabilities and exposures, penetration tests on internal and external networks, code scans on applications, allowed application listing, configuration management tools, employee awareness and training, and internal and external audits. We also review, with various frequencies, on a risk-based priority select third parties with whom we do business, in an effort to reduce the likelihood of security incidents or business interruptions. We maintain cybersecurity insurance that would apply to certain losses arising from significant security incidents.\n\nWe maintain a security operations center, supported by external providers and our employees, which provides threat detection and incident response capabilities. We maintain cyber incident response plans and related playbooks, for execution by our information security team, in coordination with stakeholders (including legal counsel). Significant incidents will be escalated to a Cybersecurity Materiality Committee to assess materiality based on qualitative and quantitative factors. The Committee is composed of a cross-divisional group of executives representing the core business functions of Information Technology and Security, Operations, Administration, Finance and Accounting, and Legal. We conduct periodic tabletop exercises, including at the executive level, to test our response processes and incident management procedures.\n\n18\n\n* * *\n\n[Table of Contents](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_7)\n\nGovernance\n\nOur Board of Directors has delegated certain responsibilities to the Audit Committee of the Board. The Audit Committee reviews and discusses with management the identification and mitigation of cybersecurity risks, including (among other things) the effectiveness of risk-management policies and practices designed to help safeguard our operations, financial systems, and data. Our Vice President of Information Security and Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) presents cybersecurity-related topics, including program maturity progress, regularly to the Audit Committee. The Internal Audit team, in its periodic compliance and risk assessment updates to the Audit Committee, also reports on its reviews of certain of our cybersecurity risk exposures, controls, and management actions. The full Board also receives cybersecurity evaluations from time to time.\n\nOur information security organization is led by our CISO, who has over eighteen years of relevant experience, serving in leadership roles across the retail and technology sectors. The CISO is responsible for all aspects of our cybersecurity program, including cybersecurity engineering and architecture, cybersecurity operations, incident response, threat intelligence, identity and access management, cybersecurity risk and compliance, and vulnerability management. Our CISO reports to our Chief Information and Digital Officer (CIDO), who has more than thirty years' experience in which he has led global digital responsibilities, including leading global cyber teams. Our CIDO reports to the Chief Executive Officer.\n\nRisks from Material Cybersecurity Threats\n\nWe and our third-party service and merchandise providers have experienced cybersecurity incidents and threats. Based on the information available as of the date of this Form 10-K, we are not aware of any risks from actual cybersecurity incidents that have materially affected us or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. It is possible that there have been intrusions into our systems that have not been identified by our controls and procedures and that might manifest in significant events at a later time. There can be no guarantee that the actions and controls we and our third-party service providers have implemented and are implementing will be sufficient to protect our systems, information or other property. See “Risk Factors” in [Item 1A](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_19) of this Form 10-K for more information on our cybersecurity-related risks.\n\nItem 2—Properties\n\nWarehouse Properties\n\nAt September\xa01, 2024, we operated 890 membership warehouses:\n\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| | Own\xa0Land and\xa0Building | | Lease\xa0Land and/or Building(1) | | Total |\n| United States and Puerto Rico | 499 | | | 115 | | | 614 | |\n| Canada | 91 | | | 17 | | | 108 | |\n| Other International | 113 | | | 55 | | | 168 | |\n| | | | | | |\n| | | | | | |\n| | | | | | |\n| | | | | | |\n| | | | | | |\n| | | | | | |\n| | | | | | |\n| | | | | | |\n| | | | | | |\n| | | | | | |\n| | | | | | |\n| | | | | | |\n| Total | 703 | | | 187 | | | 890 | |\n\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.\n\nAt the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International.

This section generally discusses the results of operations for 2024 compared to 2023. For discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for 2023 compared to 2022 refer to Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our fiscal year 2023 Form 10-K, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on October 11, 2023.\n\nOverview\n\nWe believe that the most important driver of our profitability is increasing net sales, particularly comparable sales. Net sales includes our core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, non-foods, and fresh foods), warehouse ancillary (gasoline, pharmacy, optical, food court, hearing aids, and tire installation) and other businesses (e-commerce, business centers, travel and other). E-commerce and business center sales are allocated to the appropriate merchandise categories in the Net Sales discussion. Comparable sales is defined as net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales related to e-commerce sites operating for more than one year. The measure is intended as supplemental information and is not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) and should be reviewed in conjunction with results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount they spend on each visit (average ticket). Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to our international operations) and inflation or deflation in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions. The higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage our SG&A expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term. Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States. Net sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and widespread, across a wide range of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce operations. While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private-label items, and through online offerings.\n\nOur philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices. We do not focus in the short-term on maximizing prices charged, but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our “pricing authority” – consistently providing the most competitive values. Our net sales and gross margin are influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases. Those strategies can include, but are not limited to, working with our suppliers to share in absorbing cost increases, earlier-than-usual purchasing and in greater volumes, as well as passing cost increases on to our members. Our investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, negatively impacting gross margin and gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage) in the near term.\n\n22\n\n* * *\n\n[Table of Contents](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_7)\n\nWe believe our gasoline business enhances traffic in our warehouses; it generally has a lower gross margin percentage and lower SG&A expense relative to our non-gasoline businesses. A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage. Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales. A decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect.\n\nGovernment actions in various countries relating to tariffs, particularly China and the United States, have affected the costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. Higher tariffs could adversely impact our results.\n\nWe also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth. Negative aspects of such growth include lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets. Our rate of square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. Our e-commerce business, domestically and internationally, has a lower gross-margin percentage than our warehouse operations.\n\nThe membership format is an integral part of our business and profitability. This format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of Executive memberships, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Our paid-membership growth rate may be adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets. Our worldwide renewal rate may be adversely impacted by lower renewal rates in newer markets.\n\nOur financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this area, some significant costs are partially outside our control, particularly health care and utility expenses. With respect to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover, increasing productivity and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Because our business operates on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the consolidated statements of income, particularly merchandise costs and SG&A expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income.\n\nOur operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canadian, and Other International operating segments (see [Note 11](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_139) to the consolidated financial statements included in [Item 8](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_76) of this Report). Certain operations in the Other International segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth, lower wage and benefit costs as a percentage of sales, less or no direct membership warehouse competition, or lack e-commerce or business delivery.\n\nIn discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are differences between the foreign exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars. This impact is calculated based on the difference between the current and prior period's exchange rates. The impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the difference between the current and prior period's average price per gallon sold. Results expressed excluding the impacts of foreign exchange and gasoline prices are intended as supplemental information and are not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be reviewed in conjunction with results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\n23\n\n* * *\n\n[Table of Contents](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_7)\n\nOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August\xa031. References to 2024 and 2022 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended September\xa01, 2024 and August\xa028, 2022. References to 2023 relate to the 53-week fiscal year ended September\xa03, 2023. Certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding.\n\nHighlights for 2024 include:\n\n•We opened 30 new warehouses, including one relocation: 23 net new in the U.S., one new in our Canadian segment, and five new in our Other International segment, compared to 26 new warehouses, including three relocations, in 2023;\n\n•Net sales increased 5% to $249,625, driven by an increase in comparable sales and sales at new warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by one less week of sales in 2024;\n\n•Membership fee revenue increased 5% to $4,828, driven by new member sign-ups and upgrades to Executive membership, partially offset by one less week of membership fee income in 2024;\n\n•Gross margin percentage increased 35 basis points, driven primarily by warehouse ancillary and other businesses, largely e-commerce and gasoline, and the absence of charges related to the discontinuation of our charter shipping activities recorded in 2023;\n\n•SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased six basis points, primarily due to warehouse operations and other businesses, which included the impact of wage increases in March and September 2023 and July 2024, partially offset by sales leverage and improved productivity;\n\n•The effective tax rate in 2024 was 24.4%, compared to 25.9% in 2023;\n\n•Net income increased 17% to $7,367, or $16.56 per diluted share compared to $6,292, or $14.16 per diluted share in 2023;\n\n•We paid a special cash dividend of $15 per share in January 2024; and\n\n•In April, the Board of Directors approved a 14% increase in the quarterly cash dividend.\n\n24\n\n* * *\n\n[Table of Contents](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_7)\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nNet Sales\n\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| | 2024 | | 2023 | | 2022 |\n| Net Sales | $ | 249,625 | | $ | 237,710 | | $ | 222,730 |\n| Changes in net sales: | | | | | |\n| U.S. | 4 | % | | 7 | % | | 17 | % |\n| Canada | 6 | % | | 4 | % | | 16 | % |\n| Other International | 9 | % | | 9 | % | | 10 | % |\n| Total Company | 5 | % | | 7 | % | | 16 | % |\n| Changes in comparable sales(1): | | | | | |\n| U.S. | 4 | % | | 3 | % | | 16 | % |\n| Canada | 7 | % | | 2 | % | | 15 | % |\n| Other International | 8 | % | | 3 | % | | 7 | % |\n| Total Company | 5 | % | | 3 | % | | 14 | % |\n| E-commerce | 16 | % | | (6) | % | | 10 | % |\n| Changes in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign-currency and gasoline prices(1): | | | | | |\n| U.S. | 5 | % | | 4 | % | | 10 | % |\n| Canada | 8 | % | | 8 | % | | 12 | % |\n| Other International | 8 | % | | 8 | % | | 10 | % |\n| Total Company | 6 | % | | 5 | % | | 11 | % |\n| E-commerce | 16 | % | | (5) | % | | 10 | % |\n\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n(1)Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.\n\nNet Sales\n\nNet sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.\n\nDuring 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to 2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.\n\nComparable Sales\n\nComparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight decrease in average ticket.\n\n25\n\n* * *\n\n[Table of Contents](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_7)\n\nMembership Fees\n\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| | 2024 | | 2023 | | 2022 |\n| Membership fees | $ | 4,828 | | $ | 4,580 | | $ | 4,224 |\n| Membership fees increase | 5 | % | | 8 | % | | 9 | % |\n\nMembership fee revenue increased 5% in 2024, driven by new member sign-ups and upgrades to Executive Membership. These increases were partially offset by one less week of membership fee income in 2024. At the end of 2024, our member renewal rates were 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide. Renewal rates benefited from higher penetration of Executive members. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date.\n\nEffective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star (individual), Business, and Business affiliates to $65 per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250. We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, recognized ratably over one year. We expect these fee changes to increase revenues approximately $370 over the next two years, $190 of which will benefit fiscal 2025, primarily in the latter half of the year.\n\nGross Margin\n\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| | 2024 | | 2023 | | 2022 |\n| Net sales | $ | 249,625 | | $ | 237,710 | | $ | 222,730 |\n| Less merchandise costs | 222,358 | | 212,586 | | 199,382 |\n| Gross margin | $ | 27,267 | | $ | 25,124 | | $ | 23,348 |\n| Gross margin percentage | 10.92 | % | | 10.57 | % | | 10.48 | % |\n\nGross margin percentage increased 35 basis points. Excluding the impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales, gross margin percentage was 10.88%, an increase of 31 basis points. This increase was positively impacted by: 19 basis points due to warehouse ancillary and other businesses, primarily e-commerce and gasoline; 16 basis points due to the absence of charges related to the discontinuation of our charter shipping activities that were recorded in the first and third quarters of 2023; and three basis points due to a LIFO benefit. This increase was partially offset by four basis points in our core merchandise categories and three basis points due to increased 2% rewards.\n\nThe gross margin in core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), increased 11 basis points. The increase was primarily due to non-foods, partially offset by fresh foods and foods and sundries. This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses.\n\nGross margin on a segment basis, when expressed as a percentage of the segment's own sales and excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales (segment gross margin percentage), increased in our U.S. and Canadian segments. Our U.S. segment performed similarly to the consolidated results above. Our Canadian segment gross margin percentage increased, primarily due to increases in core merchandise categories and warehouse ancillary and other businesses, partially offset by increased 2% rewards. Gross margin percentage decreased in our Other International segment, primarily due to increased 2% rewards and a decrease in core merchandise categories.\n\n26\n\n* * *\n\n[Table of Contents](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_7)\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\n\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| | 2024 | | 2023 | | 2022 |\n| SG&A expenses | $ | 22,810 | | $ | 21,590 | | $ | 19,779 |\n| SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales | 9.14 | % | | 9.08 | % | | 8.88 | % |\n\nSG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased six basis points compared to 2023.

We will continue to evaluate the impacts of Pillar 2, but do not currently expect a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\n27\n\n* * *\n\n[Table of Contents](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_7)\n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nThe following table summarizes our significant sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents:\n\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| | 2024 | | 2023 | | 2022 |\n| Net cash provided by operating activities | $ | 11,339 | | | $ | 11,068 | | | $ | 7,392 | |\n| Net cash used in investing activities | (4,409) | | | (4,972) | | | (3,915) | |\n| Net cash used in financing activities | (10,764) | | | (2,614) | | | (4,283) | |\n| | | | | | |\n\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $11,144 and $15,234 at September\xa01, 2024, and September\xa03, 2023. Of these balances, unsettled credit and debit card receivables represented approximately $2,519 and $2,282. These receivables generally settle within four days. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted cash and cash equivalents positively by $40 and $15 in 2024 and 2023, and negatively by $249 in 2022.\n\nMaterial contractual obligations arising in the normal course of business primarily consist of purchase obligations, long-term debt and related interest payments, leases, and construction and land purchase obligations. See [Notes 4](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_118) and [5](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_121) to the consolidated financial statements included in [Item 8](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_76) of this Report for amounts outstanding on September\xa01, 2024, related to debt and leases.\n\nPurchase obligations consist of contracts primarily related to merchandise, equipment, and third-party services, the majority of which are due in the next 12 months. Construction and land-purchase obligations consist of contracts primarily related to the development and opening of new and relocated warehouses, the majority of which (other than leases) are due in the next 12 months.\n\nWe believe that our cash and investment position and operating cash flow, with capacity under existing and available credit agreements, will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future and our U.S. current and projected asset position is sufficient to meet our U.S. liquidity requirements.\n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities totaled $11,339 in 2024, compared to $11,068 in 2023. Our cash flow provided by operations is primarily from net sales and membership fees. Cash flow used in operations generally consists of payments to merchandise suppliers, warehouse operating costs, including wages and employee benefits, utilities, credit and debit card processing fees, and operating leases. Cash used in operations also includes payments for income taxes. Changes in our net investment in merchandise inventories (the difference between merchandise inventories and accounts payable) is impacted by several factors, including inventory levels and turnover, payment terms with suppliers, and early payments to obtain discounts.\n\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\n\nNet cash used in investing activities totaled $4,409 in 2024, compared to $4,972 in 2023, and is primarily related to capital expenditures. Net cash from investing activities also includes purchases and maturities of short-term investments.\n\nCapital Expenditure Plans\n\nOur primary requirements for capital are acquiring land, buildings, and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses, information systems and manufacturing and distribution facilities. In 2024, we spent $4,710 on capital expenditures, and it is our current intention to spend a similar amount during fiscal 2025. These expenditures are expected to be financed with cash from operations, cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments.We opened 30 new warehouses, including one relocation, in 2024, and plan to\n\n28\n\n* * *\n\n[Table of Contents](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_7)\n\nopen up to 29 additional new warehouses, including three relocations, in 2025. There can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review of our capital expenditure needs and the economic environment.\n\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\n\nNet cash used in financing activities totaled $10,764 in 2024, compared to $2,614 in 2023. Cash flow used in financing activities primarily related to the payment of dividends, repayments of long-term debt and short-term borrowings, repurchases of common stock, and withholding taxes on stock-based awards. On May 18, 2024, we paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance on the 2.750% Senior Notes, using cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Cash flow provided by financing activities included proceeds from short-term borrowings and four Guaranteed Senior Notes totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%, issued by our Japan subsidiary.\n\nDividends\n\nCash dividends declared in 2024 totaled $8,589 or $19.36 per share, as compared to $1,703 or $3.84 per share in 2023. Dividends in 2024 included a special dividend of $15 per share, resulting in a payment of approximately $6,655. In April 2024, the Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $1.02 to $1.16 per share.\n\nShare Repurchase Program\n\nOn January 19, 2023, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program in the amount of $4,000, which expires in January 2027. During 2024 and 2023, we repurchased 1,004,000 and 1,341,000 shares of common stock, at an average price per share of $695.29 and $504.68, totaling approximately $698 and $677. These amounts may differ from the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled repurchases at the end of each fiscal year. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases, pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $2,865 at the end of 2024.\n\nBank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs\n\nWe maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes. At September\xa01, 2024, we had borrowing capacity under these facilities of $1,198. Our international operations maintain $710 of this capacity under bank credit facilities, of which $167 is guaranteed by the Company.\xa0Short-term borrowings outstanding under the bank credit facilities, which are included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.\n\nWe have letter of credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $214. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at the end of 2024 totaled $193, most of which were standby letters of credit that do not expire or have expiration dates within one year. The bank credit facilities have various expiration dates, most within one year, and we generally intend to renew these facilities. The amount of borrowings available at any time under our bank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit outstanding.\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nIn the opinion of management, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition or financial statements.\n\n29\n\n* * *\n\n[Table of Contents](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_7)\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, and we continue to review and evaluate these estimates. For further information on significant accounting policies, see discussion in [Note 1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_106) to the consolidated financial statements included in [Item\xa08](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_76) of this Report.\n\nInsurance/Self-insurance Liabilities\n\nClaims for employee health-care benefits, workers’ compensation, general liability, property damage, directors’ and officers’ liability, vehicle liability, inventory loss, and other exposures are funded predominantly through self-insurance. Insurance coverage is maintained for certain risks to limit exposures to very large losses. We use various risk management mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, and participate in a reinsurance program. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated using historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The costs of claims are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate as a result of inflation rates, regulatory or legal changes, and unforeseen developments in claims. While we believe our estimates are reasonable, actual claims and costs could differ significantly from recorded liabilities. Historically, adjustments to our estimates have been immaterial.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nSee discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements in [Note 1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_106) to the consolidated financial statements included in [Item 8](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_76) of this Report.\n\nItem\xa07A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (amounts in millions)\n\nOur exposure to financial market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among various instruments considered to be cash equivalents, as defined in [Note 1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_106) to the consolidated financial statements included in [Item 8](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_76) of this Report, as well as short-term investments in government and agency securities with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase.\xa0The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields.\xa0The majority of our short-term investments are in fixed interest-rate securities. These securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations.\n\nOur policy limits investments in the U.S. to direct U.S. government and government agency\xa0obligations, repurchase agreements\xa0collateralized by U.S. government and government agency obligations, U.S. government and government agency money market funds, and insured bank balances. Our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. government and government agency obligations and U.S. government and government agency money market funds. Our Canadian and Other International subsidiaries’ investments are primarily in money market funds, bankers’ acceptances, and bank certificates of deposit, generally denominated in local currencies.\n\nA 100 basis point change in interest rates as of the end of 2024 would have had an immaterial incremental change in fair market value. For those investments that are classified as available-for-sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected\n\n30\n\n* * *\n\n[Table of Contents](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_7)\n\nwithin stockholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe nature and amount of our long-term debt may vary as a result of business requirements, market conditions, and other factors. As of the end of 2024, long-term debt with fixed interest rates was $5,919. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed-rate debt. See [Note 4](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_118) to the consolidated financial statements included in [Item 8](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_76) of this Report for more information on our long-term debt.\n\nForeign Currency Risk\n\nOur foreign subsidiaries conduct certain transactions in non-functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of these fluctuations on known future expenditures denominated in a non-functional foreign-currency. The contracts are intended primarily to economically hedge exposure to U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by our international subsidiaries. We seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. For additional information related to the Company's forward foreign-exchange contracts, see [Notes 1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_106) and [3](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_115) to the consolidated financial statements included in [Item\xa08](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_76) of this Report. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currencies compared to the non-functional currency exchange rates at September\xa01, 2024, would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by approximately $120 and resulted in an unrealized loss in the consolidated statements of income for the same amount.\n\nCommodity Price Risk\n\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy, particularly electricity and natural gas, and other commodities used in retail and manufacturing operations, which we seek to partially mitigate through fixed-price contracts for certain of our warehouses and other facilities, predominantly in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable-priced contracts for some purchases of electricity and natural gas, in addition to some of the fuel for our gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments, but generally qualify for the “normal purchases and normal sales” exception under authoritative guidance and require no mark-to-market adjustment.\n\n31\n\n* * *\n\n[Table of Contents](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_7)\n\nItem 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\n\nCOSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION\n\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n| | | | | | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| | | | | | |\n| | Page |\n| | |\n| [Reports of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_82) | [33](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_82) |\n| [Consolidated Statements of Income](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_85) | [36](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_85) |\n| [Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_88) | [37](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_88) |\n| [Consolidated Balance Sheets](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_91) | [38](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_91) |\n| [Consolidated Statements of Equity](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_97) | [39](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_97) |\n| [Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_100) | [40](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_100) |\n| [Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_103) | [41](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_103) |\n\n32\n\n* * *\n\n[Table of Contents](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_7)\n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\n\nCostco Wholesale Corporation:\n\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Costco Wholesale Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September\xa01, 2024 and September\xa03, 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended September\xa01, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September\xa01, 2024 and September\xa03, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended September\xa01, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of September\xa01, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated October\xa08, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nCritical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n33\n\n* * *\n\n[Table of Contents](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_7)\n\nEvaluation of workers' compensation self-insurance liabilities\n\nAs discussed in [Note 1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_106) to the consolidated financial statements, the Company estimates its self-insurance liabilities by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated self-insurance liabilities as of September\xa01, 2024, were $1,612 million, a portion of which related to workers’ compensation self-insurance liabilities for the United States operations.\n\nWe identified the evaluation of the Company’s workers’ compensation self-insurance liabilities for the United States operations as a critical audit matter because of the extent of specialized skill and knowledge needed to evaluate the underlying assumptions and judgments made by the Company in the actuarial models. Specifically, subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate the Company's selected loss rates and initial expected losses used in the actuarial models.\n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s self-insurance workers' compensation process. This included controls related to the development and selection of the assumptions listed above used in the actuarial calculation and review of the actuarial report. We involved actuarial professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in:\n\n•Assessing the actuarial models used by the Company for consistency with generally accepted actuarial standards\n\n•Evaluating the Company’s ability to estimate self-insurance workers' compensation liabilities by comparing its historical estimates with actual incurred losses and paid losses\n\n•Evaluating the above listed assumptions underlying the Company’s actuarial estimates by developing an independent expectation of the self-insurance workers' compensation liabilities and comparing them to the amounts recorded by the Company.\n\n/s/ KPMG LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002.\n\nSeattle, Washington\n\nOctober\xa08, 2024\n\n34\n\n* * *\n\n[Table of Contents](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_7)\n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\n\nCostco Wholesale Corporation:\n\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nWe have audited Costco Wholesale Corporation andsubsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of September\xa01, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September\xa01, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of September\xa01, 2024 and September\xa03, 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended September\xa01, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated October\xa08, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n/s/ KPMG LLP\n\nSeattle, Washington\n\nOctober\xa08, 2024\n\n35\n\n* * *\n\n[Table of

(Costco or the Company), a Washington corporation, and its subsidiaries operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. At September\xa01, 2024, Costco operated 890 warehouses worldwide: 614 in the United States (U.S.) located in 47 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, 108 in Canada, 40 in Mexico, 35 in Japan, 29 in the U.K., 19 in Korea, 15 in Australia, 14 in Taiwan, seven in China, four in Spain, two in France, and one each in Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. The Company operates e-commerce sites in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Mexico, Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia.\n\nBasis of Presentation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Costco and its subsidiaries. The Company reports noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as a component of equity separate from the Company’s equity. All material inter-company transactions between and among the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco.\n\nFiscal Year End\n\nThe Company operates on a 52/53-week fiscal year basis with the year ending on the Sunday closest to August\xa031. References to 2024 and 2022 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended September\xa01, 2024 and August\xa028, 2022. References to 2023 relate to the 53-week fiscal year ended September\xa03, 2023.\n\nUse of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions take into account historical and forward-looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.\n\nReclassification\n\nReclassifications were made to the 2023 and 2022 consolidated statements of cash flows to conform with current year presentation.\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n\nThe Company considers as cash and cash equivalents all cash on deposit, highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase, and proceeds due from credit and debit card transactions with settlement terms of up to four days. Credit and debit card receivables were $2,519 and $2,282 at the end of 2024 and 2023.\n\nShort-Term Investments\n\nShort-term investments generally consist of debt securities (U.S. government and agency securities), with maturities at the date of purchase of three months to five years. Investments with maturities beyond five\n\n41\n\n* * *\n\n[Table of Contents](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_7)\n\nyears may be classified, based on the Company’s determination, as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because they represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. Short-term investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value using the specific identification method with the unrealized gains and losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until realized. Realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities, if any, are determined on a specific identification basis and are recorded in interest income and other, net in the consolidated statements of income. These available-for-sale investments have a low level of inherent credit risk given they are issued by the U.S. government and agencies. Changes in their fair value are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates and market liquidity. Short-term investments classified as held-to-maturity are financial instruments that the Company has the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are reported net of any related amortization and are not remeasured to fair value on a recurring basis.\n\nThe Company periodically evaluates unrealized losses in its investment securities for credit impairment, using both qualitative and quantitative criteria. In the event a security is deemed to be impaired as the result of a credit loss, the Company recognizes the loss in interest income and other, net in the consolidated statements of income.\n\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nThe Company accounts for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable, approximate fair value due to their short-term nature or variable interest rates. See [Notes 2](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_112), [3](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_115), and [4](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_118) for the carrying value and fair value of the Company’s investments, derivative instruments, and fixed-rate debt.\n\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is estimated by applying a fair value hierarchy, which requires maximizing the use of observable inputs when measuring fair value. The three levels of inputs are:\n\nLevel 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market\n\ndata.\n\nLevel 3: Significant unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.\n\nThe Company’s valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market mutual funds, which are included in cash and cash equivalents, are based on quoted market prices, such as quoted net asset values published by the fund as supported in an active market. Valuation methodologies used to measure the fair value of all other non-derivative financial instruments are based on independent external valuation information. The pricing process uses data from a variety of independent external valuation information providers, including trades, bid price or spread, two-sided markets, quotes, benchmark curves including but not limited to treasury benchmarks, Secured Overnight Financing Rate and swap curves, discount rates, and market data feeds. All are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. The Company reports transfers in and out of Levels 1, 2, and 3, as applicable, using the fair value of the individual securities as of the beginning of the reporting period in which the transfer(s) occurred.\n\nCurrent financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. Long-term financial liabilities include the Company's long-term debt, which are recorded on the balance sheet at issuance price and adjusted for unamortized discounts or premiums and debt issuance costs. Discounts, premiums and debt issuance costs are amortized to interest expense over the term of the loan. The estimated fair value of the Company's long-term debt is based primarily on reported market values, recently completed market transactions, and estimates based upon interest rates, maturities, and credit.\n\n42\n\n* * *\n\n[Table of Contents](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_7)\n\nReceivables, Net\n\nReceivables consist primarily of vendor, reinsurance, credit card incentive, third-party pharmacy and other receivables. Vendor receivables include discounts and volume rebates. Balances are generally presented on a gross basis, separate from any related payable due. In certain circumstances, these receivables may be settled against the related payable to that vendor, in which case the receivables are presented on a net basis. Reinsurance receivables are held by the Company’s wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and primarily represent amounts ceded through reinsurance arrangements gross of the amounts assumed under reinsurance, which are presented within other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Credit card incentive receivables primarily represent amounts earned under co-branded credit card arrangements. Third-party pharmacy receivables generally relate to amounts due from members’ insurers. Other receivables primarily consist of amounts due from governmental entities, mostly tax-related items.\n\nThe valuation allowance related to receivables was immaterial to the Company's consolidated financial statements at the end of 2024 and 2023.\n\nMerchandise Inventories\n\nMerchandise inventories consist of the following:\n\n| | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| | 2024 | | 2023 |\n| United States | $ | 13,625 | | | $ | 12,153 | |\n| Canada | 1,895 | | | 1,579 | |\n| Other International | 3,127 | | | 2,919 | |\n| Merchandise inventories | $ | 18,647 | | | $ | 16,651 | |\n\nMerchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. U.S. merchandise inventories are valued by the cost method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the projected annual effect of inflation or deflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end, after actual inflation or deflation rates and inventory levels have been determined. An immaterial LIFO benefit was recorded in 2024 and an immaterial charge was recorded in 2023. Due to inflation in 2022, a $438 charge was recorded to merchandise costs to increase the cumulative LIFO valuation on merchandise inventories at August 28, 2022. Canadian and Other International merchandise inventories are predominantly valued using the cost and retail inventory methods, respectively, using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis.\n\nThe Company initially provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts using estimates based on experience. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning those rebates, provided that they are probable and reasonably estimable.\n\nProperty and Equipment, Net\n\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization expense is computed primarily using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements made after the beginning of the initial lease term are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining term of the initial lease plus any renewals that are reasonably certain at the date the leasehold improvements are made.\n\nThe Company capitalizes certain computer software and costs incurred in developing or obtaining software for internal use. During development, these costs are included in construction in progress. To the\n\n43\n\n* * *\n\n[Table of Contents](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_7)\n\nextent that the assets become ready for their intended use, these costs are included in equipment and fixtures and amortized on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives.\n\nRepair and maintenance costs are expensed when incurred. Expenditures for remodels, refurbishments and improvements that add to or change asset function or useful life are capitalized. Assets removed during the remodel, refurbishment or improvement are retired. Assets classified as held-for-sale at the end of 2024 and 2023 were immaterial.\n\nThe following table summarizes the Company's property and equipment balances at the end of 2024 and 2023:\n\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| | Estimated Useful Lives | | 2024 | | 2023 |\n| Land | N/A | | $ | 9,447 | | | $ | 8,590 | |\n| Buildings and improvements | 5-50 years | | 23,727 | | | 22,001 | |\n| Equipment and fixtures | 3-20 years | | 12,387 | | | 11,512 | |\n| Construction in progress | N/A | | 1,389 | | | 1,266 | |\n| | | | 46,950 | | | 43,369 | |\n| Accumulated depreciation and amortization | | (17,918) | | | (16,685) | |\n| Property and equipment, net | | $ | 29,032 | | | $ | 26,684 | |\n\nThe Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment on an annual basis, when relocating or closing a facility, or when events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group, generally an individual warehouse, may not be fully recoverable. For asset groups held and used, including warehouses to be relocated, the carrying value of the asset group is considered recoverable when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group exceed the respective carrying value. In the event that the carrying value is not considered recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized for the asset group to be held and used equal to the excess of the carrying value above the estimated fair value of the asset group. For asset groups classified as held-for-sale (disposal group), the carrying value is compared to the disposal group’s fair value less costs to sell. The Company estimates fair value by obtaining market appraisals from third party brokers or using other valuation techniques. Impairment charges recognized in 2024 and 2023 were immaterial. In 2022, the Company recognized a write-off of $118 for information technology assets, which is reflected in SG&A.\n\nLeases\n\nThe Company leases land, buildings, and/or equipment at warehouses and certain other office and distribution facilities. Leases generally contain one or more of the following options, which the Company can exercise at the end of the initial term: (a) renew the lease for a defined number of years at the then-fair market rental rate or rate stipulated in the lease agreement; (b) purchase the property at the then-fair market value or purchase price stated in the agreement; (c)\xa0a right of first refusal in the event of a third-party offer; or (d) a right of first offer if the landlord intends to sell.\n\nSome leases include free-rent periods and step-rent provisions, which are recognized on a straight-line basis over the original term of the lease and any extension options that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise from the date the Company has control of the property. Certain leases provide for periodic rent increases based on price indices or the greater of minimum guaranteed amounts or sales volume, which are recognized as variable lease payments. The Company's leases do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\n\nThe Company determines at inception whether a contract is or contains a lease. Non-lease components and the lease components to which they relate are accounted for together as a single lease component for all asset classes. The Company initially records right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease obligations for its\n\n44\n\n* * *\n\n[Table of Contents](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_7)\n\nfinance and operating leases based on the discounted future minimum lease payments over the term. The lease term is defined as the noncancelable period of the lease plus any options to extend when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. As the rate implicit in the Company's leases is not easily determinable, the present value of the sum of the lease payments is calculated using the Company's incremental borrowing rate. The rate is determined using a portfolio approach based on the rate of interest the Company would pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term. The Company uses quoted interest rates from financial institutions to derive the incremental borrowing rate. Impairment of ROU assets is evaluated in a similar manner as described in Property and Equipment, Net above. During 2023, the Company recognized charges totaling $391, primarily related to the impairment of certain leased assets associated with charter shipping activities. This charge is included in merchandise costs.\n\nThe Company's asset retirement obligations (ARO) primarily relate to leasehold improvements that must be removed at the end of a lease. These obligations are generally recorded as a discounted liability, with an offsetting asset at the inception of the lease term, based upon the estimated fair value of the costs to remove the improvements. These liabilities are accreted over time to the projected future value of the obligation. The ARO assets are depreciated using the same depreciation method as the leasehold improvement assets and are included in buildings and improvements. Estimated ARO liabilities associated with these leases are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nGoodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.\n\nGoodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable segment:\n\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| | United States | | Canada | | Other International | | Total |\n| Balance at August 28, 2022 | $ | 953 | | | $ | 27 | | | $ | 13 | | | $ | 993 | |\n| Changes in currency translation | — | | | (1) | | | 2 | | | 1 | |\n| Balance at September 3, 2023 | $ | 953 | | | $ | 26 | | | $ | 15 | | | $ | 994 | |\n| Changes in currency translation | — | | | — | | | — | | | — | |\n| Balance at September 1, 2024 | $ | 953 | | | $ | 26 | | | $ | 15 | | | $ | 994 | |\n\nDefinite-lived intangible assets, which are immaterial, are included in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives, which approximates the pattern of expected economic benefit.\n\nInsurance/Self-insurance Liabilities\n\nClaims for employee health-care benefits, workers’ compensation, general liability, property damage, directors’ and officers’ liability, vehicle liability, inventory loss, and other exposures are funded predominantly through self-insurance. Insurance coverage is maintained for certain risks to limit exposures to very large losses. The Company uses various risk management mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary (the captive) and participates in a reinsurance program. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and are\n\n45\n\n* * *\n\n[Table of Contents](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_7)\n\nestimated using historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences, claims, or expenses differ from these assumptions and historical trends. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these insurance liabilities were $1,612 and $1,513 in the aggregate, and were included in accrued salaries and benefits and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, classified based on their nature.\n\nThe captive receives direct premiums, which are netted against the Company’s premium costs in SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of income. The captive participates in a reinsurance program that includes third-party participants. The participant agreements and practices of the reinsurance program are designed to limit a participating members’ individual risk. Income statement adjustments related to the reinsurance program and related impacts to the consolidated balance sheets are recognized as information becomes known. In the event the Company leaves the reinsurance program, the Company retains its primary obligation to the participants for prior activity.\n\nDerivatives\n\nThe Company is exposed to foreign-currency exchange-rate fluctuations in the normal course of business. It manages these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a non-functional foreign-currency. The contracts relate primarily to U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by the Company’s international subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Currently, these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. The Company seeks to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and does not intend to engage in speculative transactions. Some of these contracts contain credit-risk-related contingent features that require settlement of outstanding contracts upon certain triggering events. The aggregate fair value amounts of derivative instruments in a net liability position and the amount needed to settle the instruments immediately if the credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023. The aggregate notional amounts of open, unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts were $1,212 and $1,068 at the end of 2024 and 2023. See [Note 3](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_115) for information on the fair value of unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts at the end of 2024 and 2023.\n\nThe unrealized gains or losses recognized in interest income and other, net in the consolidated statements of income relating to the net changes in the fair value of unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts were immaterial in2024,2023 and 2022.\n\nThe Company is exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy, particularly electricity and natural gas, and other commodity products used in retail and manufacturing operations, which it seeks to partially mitigate through the use of fixed-price contracts for certain of its warehouses and other facilities, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. The Company also enters into variable-priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas, in addition to fuel for its gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments, but generally qualify for the “normal purchases and normal sales” exception under authoritative guidance and require no mark-to-market adjustment.\n\nForeign Currency\n\nThe functional currencies of the Company’s international subsidiaries are their local currencies. Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Revenues and expenses of the Company’s consolidated foreign operations are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the year.\n\nThe Company recognizes foreign-currency transaction gains and losses related to revaluing or settling monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency in interest income and other, net in the consolidated statements of income. Generally, these include the U.S. dollar cash and cash equivalents and the U.S. dollar payables of consolidated subsidiaries revalued to their\n\n46\n\n* * *\n\n[Table of Contents](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_7)\n\nfunctional currency. Also included are realized foreign-currency gains or losses from settlements of forward foreign-exchange contracts. These items were $64, $46 and $84 in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nThe Company recognizes sales for the amount of consideration collected from the member, which includes gross shipping fees where applicable, and is net of sales taxes collected and remitted to government agencies and member returns. The Company reserves for estimated returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns and reduces sales and merchandise costs accordingly. The Company records, on a gross basis, a refund liability and an asset for recovery, which are included in other current liabilities and other current assets, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe Company offers merchandise in the following core merchandise categories: foods and sundries, non-foods, and fresh foods. The Company also provides expanded products and services through warehouse ancillary and other businesses. The Company is the principal for the majority of its transactions and recognizes revenue on a gross basis. The Company is the principal when it has control of the merchandise or service before it is transferred to the member. The majority of revenue from merchandise sales is recognized at the point of sale. Revenue generated through e-commerce or special orders is generally recognized upon shipment to the member. For merchandise shipped directly to the member, shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred as fulfillment costs and included in merchandise costs in the consolidated statements of income. In certain ancillary businesses, revenue is deferred until the member picks up merchandise at the warehouse. Deferred sales are included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe Company accounts for membership fee revenue, net of refunds, on a deferred basis, ratably over the one-year membership period. Deferred membership fees at the end of 2024 and 2023 were $2,501 and $2,337.\n\nIn most countries, the Company's Executive members qualify for a 2% reward on qualified purchases, subject to an annual maximum value, which does not expire and is redeemable at Costco warehouses. The Company accounts for this reward as a reduction in sales, net of the estimated impact of non-redemptions (breakage), with the corresponding liability classified as accrued member rewards in the consolidated balance sheets. Estimated breakage is computed based on redemption data. For\xa02024, 2023,\xa0and 2022, the net reduction in sales was\xa0$2,804,\xa0$2,576, and $2,307.\n\nThe Company sells and otherwise provides proprietary shop cards that do not expire and are redeemable at the warehouse or online for merchandise or membership. Revenue from shop cards is recognized upon redemption, and estimated breakage is recognized based on redemption data. The Company accounts for outstanding shop card balances as a shop card liability, net of estimated breakage. Shop card liabilities are included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nCitibank, N.A. is the exclusive issuer of co-branded credit cards to U.S. members. The Company receives various forms of consideration from Citibank, including a royalty on purchases made on the card outside of Costco. A portion of the royalty is used to fund the rebate that cardholders receive, after taking into consideration breakage, which is calculated based on rebate redemption data. The rebates are issued in February and expire on December 31. The Company also maintains co-branded credit card arrangements in Canada and certain other International subsidiaries.\n\nMerchandise Costs\n\nMerchandise costs consist of the purchase price or manufacturing costs of inventory sold, inbound and outbound shipping charges and all costs related to the Company’s depot, fulfillment and manufacturing operations, and are reduced by vendor consideration. Merchandise costs also include salaries, benefits, depreciation, and utilities in fresh foods departments and certain ancillary businesses.\n\n47\n\n* * *\n\n[Table of Contents](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_7)\n\nVendor Consideration\n\nThe Company receives funds from vendors for discounts and a variety of other programs. These programs are evidenced by agreements that are reflected in the carrying value of the inventory when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning the rebate or discount, and as a component of merchandise costs as the merchandise is sold. Other vendor consideration is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, agreement terms or another systematic approach.\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and workers’ compensation costs for warehouse employees (other than fresh foods departments and certain ancillary businesses, which are reflected in merchandise costs) as well as all regional and home office employees, including buying personnel. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include substantially all building and equipment depreciation, stock compensation expense, credit and debit card processing fees, utilities, preopening, as well as other operating costs incurred to support warehouse and e-commerce operations.\n\nRetirement Plans\n\nThe Company's 401(k) retirement plan is available to all U.S. employees over the age of 18 who have completed 90 days of employment. The plan allows participants to make wage deferral contributions, a portion of which the Company matches. In addition, the Company provides each eligible participant an annual discretionary contribution. The Company also has a defined contribution plan for employees in Canada and contributes a percentage of each employee's wages. Certain subsidiaries in the Company's Other International operations have defined benefit and defined contribution plans, which are immaterial. Amounts expensed under all plans were $963, $914, and $824 for 2024, 2023, and 2022, and are predominantly included in SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of income.\n\nStock-Based Compensation\n\nThe Company grants stock-based compensation, primarily to employees and non-employee directors. Grants to executive officers are generally performance-based. Through a series of shareholder approvals, there have been amended and restated plans and new provisions implemented by the Company. Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) granted to employees and to non-employee directors generally vest over five years and three years and are subject to quarterly vesting in the event of retirement or voluntary termination. Employees who attain at least 25 years of service with the Company and non-employee directors with five or more years receive shares under accelerated vesting provisions. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur.\n\nCompensation expense for awards is predominantly recognized using the straight-line method over the requisite service period for the entire award. The terms of the RSUs, including performance-based awards, provide for accelerated vesting for employees and non-employee directors. Recipients are not entitled to vote or receive dividends on unvested and undelivered shares. Compensation expense for the accelerated shares is recognized upon achievement of the long-service term. The cumulative amount of compensation cost recognized at any point in time equals at least the portion of the grant-date fair value of the award that is vested at that date. The fair value of RSUs is calculated as the market value of the common stock on the measurement date less the present value of the expected dividends forgone during the vesting period.\n\nStock-based compensation expense is predominantly included in SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Certain stock-based compensation costs are capitalized or included in the cost of merchandise. See [Note 7](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_127) for additional information.\n\n48\n\n* * *\n\n[Table of Contents](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_7)\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributed to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases, credits and loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carry-forwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized.\n\nThe timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions requires significant judgment. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in the Company’s consolidated financial statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, the Company reassesses these probabilities and records changes as appropriate.\n\nNet Income per Common Share Attributable to Costco\n\nThe computation of basic net income per share uses the weighted average number of shares that were outstanding during the period. The computation of diluted net income per share uses the weighted average number of shares in the basic net income per share calculation plus the number of common shares that would be issued assuming vesting of all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding using the treasury stock method for shares subject to RSUs.\n\nStock Repurchase Programs\n\nRepurchased shares of common stock are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. The par value of repurchased shares is deducted from common stock and the excess repurchase price over par value is deducted by allocation to additional paid-in capital and retained earnings. The amount allocated to additional paid-in capital is the current value of additional paid-in capital per share outstanding and is applied to the number of shares repurchased. Any remaining amount is allocated to retained earnings.

The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The amendments should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements.\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, which focuses on income tax disclosures by requiring public business entities, on an annual basis, to disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation, provide information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold, and certain information about income taxes paid. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The amendments should be applied on a prospective basis. Retrospective application is permitted.\n\nThe Company is evaluating both standards.\n\n49\n\n* * *\n\n[Table of Contents](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_7)\n\nNote 2—Investments\n\nThe Company’s investments were as follows:\n\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| 2024: | Cost Basis | | Unrealized Losses, Net | | Recorded Basis |\n| Available-for-sale: | | | | | |\n| Government and agency securities | $ | 689 | | | $ | (1) | | | $ | 688 | |\n| | | | | | |\n| | | | | | |\n| | | | | | |\n| Held-to-maturity: | | | | | |\n| Certificates of deposit | 550 | | | — | | | 550 | |\n| | | | | | |\n| | | | | | |\n| Total short-term investments | $ | 1,239 | | | $ | (1) | | | $ | 1,238 | |\n\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| 2023: | Cost Basis | | Unrealized Losses, Net | | Recorded Basis |\n| Available-for-sale: | | | | | |\n| Government and agency securities | $ | 650 | | | $ | (17) | | | $ | 633 | |\n| | | | | | |\n| | | | | | |\n| | | | | | |\n| Held-to-maturity: | | | | | |\n| Certificates of deposit | 901 | | | — | | | 901 | |\n| | | | | | |\n| | | | | | |\n| Total short-term investments | $ | 1,551 | | | $ | (17) | | | $ | 1,534 | |\n\nGross unrecognized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities were immaterial for the years ended September\xa01, 2024, and September\xa03, 2023.

There were no transfers between levels during 2024 or 2023.\n\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\n\nAssets and liabilities recognized and disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include items such as financial assets measured at amortized cost and long-lived nonfinancial assets. These assets are measured at fair value if determined to be impaired. There were no material fair value adjustments to these items during 2024. Please see [Note 1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_106) for additional information.\n\nNote 4—Debt\n\nShort-Term Borrowings\n\nThe Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.\n\nLong-Term Debt\n\nThe Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.\n\nOther long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.\n\nOn May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.\n\nAt the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and $5,738.

share, as compared to $1,703 or $3.84 per share in 2023. Dividends in 2024 included a special dividend of $15 per share, resulting in a payment of approximately $6,655. The Company's current quarterly dividend rate is $1.16 per share.\n\nStock Repurchase Programs\n\nThe Company's stock repurchase program is conducted under a $4,000 authorization by the Board of Directors, which expires in\xa0January 2027. As of the end of 2024, the remaining amount available under the authorization was $2,865. The following table summarizes the Company’s stock repurchase activity:\n\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| | Shares Repurchased (000’s) | | Average Price\xa0per Share | | Total\xa0Cost |\n| 2024 | 1,004 | | | $ | 695.29 | | | $ | 698 | |\n| 2023 | 1,341 | | | 504.68 | | | 677 | |\n| 2022 | 863 | | | 511.46 | | | 442 | |\n\nThese amounts may differ from repurchases of common stock in the consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled stock repurchases at the end of each fiscal year. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1.\n\nNote 7—Stock-Based Compensation\n\nThe 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of\xa017,500,000\xa0shares (10,000,000\xa0RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate of\xa027,800,000\xa0shares (15,885,000\xa0RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.\n\nAs required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of 1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted, which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.\n\nSummary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity\n\nAt the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special dividend, were outstanding:\n\n•2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and\n\n•122,000performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000\xa0were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time.

In 2023 and 2022, tax benefits of $54 and $94 were recognized related to stock compensation.\n\n56\n\n* * *\n\n[Table of Contents](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_7)\n\nThe components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:\n\n| | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| | 2024 | | 2023 |\n| Deferred tax assets: | | | |\n| Equity compensation | $ | 96 | | | $ | 89 | |\n| Deferred income/membership fees | 313 | | | 309 | |\n| Foreign tax credit carry forward | 315 | | | 250 | |\n| Operating lease liabilities | 678 | | | 678 | |\n| Accrued liabilities and reserves | 873 | | | 761 | |\n| Other | — | | | 20 | |\n| Total deferred tax assets | 2,275 | | | 2,107 | |\n| Valuation allowance | (494) | | | (422) | |\n| Total net deferred tax assets | 1,781 | | | 1,685 | |\n| Deferred tax liabilities: | | | |\n| Property and equipment | (948) | | | (867) | |\n| Merchandise inventories | (296) | | | (380) | |\n| Operating lease right-of-use assets | (652) | | | (655) | |\n| Foreign branch deferreds | (105) | | | (87) | |\n| Other | (1) | | | — | |\n| Total deferred tax liabilities | (2,002) | | | (1,989) | |\n| Net deferred tax liabilities | $ | (221) | | | $ | (304) | |\n\nThe deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.\n\nIn 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carry forwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.\n\nThe Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and has not provided for withholding or state taxes.\n\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\n\n| | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| | 2024 | | 2023 |\n| Gross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year | $ | 16 | | | $ | 16 | |\n| Gross increases—current year tax positions | 3 | | | 1 | |\n| Gross increases—tax positions in prior years | 64 | | | 11 | |\n| Gross decreases—tax positions in prior years | — | | | (11) | |\n| | | | |\n| Lapse of statute of limitations | (2) | | | (1) | |\n| Gross unrecognized tax benefit at end of year | $ | 81 | | | $ | 16 | |\n\n57\n\n* * *\n\n[Table of Contents](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_7)\n\nThe gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.\n\nAccrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.\n\nThe Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12 months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months.\n\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.\n\nOther Taxes\n\nThe Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter or year.\n\nNote 9—Net Income per Common and Common Equivalent Share\n\nThe following table shows the amounts used in computing net income per share and the weighted average number of shares of basic and of potentially dilutive common shares outstanding (shares in 000’s):\n\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| | 2024 | | 2023 | | 2022 |\n| Net income attributable to Costco | $ | 7,367 | | | $ | 6,292 | | | $ | 5,844 | |\n| Weighted average basic shares | 443,914 | | | 443,854 | | | 443,651 | |\n| RSUs | 845 | | | 598 | | | 1,106 | |\n| Weighted average diluted shares | 444,759 | | | 444,452 | | | 444,757 | |\n\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated based on the dilutive effect of RSUs using the treasury stock method.\n\nNote 10—Commitments and Contingencies\n\nLegal Proceedings\n\nThe Company is involved in many claims, proceedings and litigations arising from its business and property ownership. In accordance with accounting guidance, the Company establishes an accrual for legal proceedings if and when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and\n\n58\n\n* * *\n\n[Table of Contents](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_7)\n\nreasonably estimable. There may be actual losses in excess of amounts accrued. The Company monitors those matters for developments that would affect the likelihood of a loss (taking into account where applicable indemnification arrangements concerning suppliers and insurers) and the accrued amount, if any, thereof, and adjusts the amount as appropriate. The Company has recorded immaterial accruals with respect to certain matters described below, in addition to other immaterial accruals for matters not described below. If the loss contingency at issue is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not establish an accrual, but monitors for developments that make the contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. In each case, there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, including a loss in excess of the applicable accrual. For matters where no accrual has been recorded, the possible loss or range of loss (including any loss in excess of the accrual) cannot, in the Company's view, be reasonably estimated because, among other things: the remedies or penalties sought are indeterminate or unspecified; the legal and/or factual theories are not well developed; and/or the matters involve complex or novel legal theories or a large number of parties.\n\nIn November 2023, a former employee filed a class action against the Company alleging claims under California law for failure to pay minimum wage, failure to pay overtime, failure to provide meal and rest breaks, failure to provide accurate wage statements, failure to reimburse expenses, failure to pay wages when due, and failure to pay sick pay. Martin Reyes v. Costco Wholesale Corporation, Sacramento County Superior Court (Case No. 23cv011351), removed to federal court, Case No. 2:24-cv-00300 (E.D. Cal.). A second amended complaint was filed, which the Company has moved to dismiss. In January 2024, the same plaintiff filed a related Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) representative action, seeking civil penalties and asserting the same alleged underlying Labor Code violations and an additional suitable seating claim. In May 2024, the plaintiff filed an amended PAGA complaint; the Company has denied the material allegations of the complaint and filed a motion to stay the action.\n\nIn October 2023, current and former employees filed suit against the Company asserting collective and class claims on behalf of all “Junior Managers” under the Fair Labor Standards Act and New York Labor Law, for failure to pay overtime compensation and for inaccurate wage statements under New York law. Lock et al. v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 2:23-cv-07904; E.D.N.Y.). On February 1, 2024, the Company served a motion to dismiss the inaccurate wage-statement claim. On April 5, 2024, plaintiffs filed a motion for conditional certification under the Act, which the Company has opposed.\n\nIn July 2021, a former temporary staffing employee filed a class action against the Company and a staffing company, alleging violations of the California Labor Code regarding payment of wages, meal and rest periods, wage statements, the timeliness of wages and final wages, and for unfair business practices. Dimas v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. STK-CV-UOE-2021-0006024; San Joaquin Superior Court). The Company has moved to compel arbitration of the plaintiff's individual claims and to dismiss the class action complaint. On September 7, 2021, the same plaintiff filed a separate representative action under the California Private Attorneys General Act, asserting the same Labor Code violations and seeking civil penalties and attorneys' fees. The case has been stayed pending arbitration of the plaintiff's individual claims.\n\nIn May 2022, an employee filed an action under PAGA against the Company, alleging claims under the California Labor Code regarding the payment of wages, meal and rest periods, the timeliness of wages and final wages, wage statements, accurate records and business expenses. Gonzalez v. Costco Wholesale Corp. (Case No. 22AHCV00255; Los Angeles Superior Court). The Company filed an answer denying the allegations. On October 31, 2023, a settlement was reached for an immaterial amount. Preliminary approval of the settlement was given in July, and a hearing for final approval has been set for October.\n\nIn August 2024, an employee filed an action under PAGA against the Company, alleging claims for penalties for alleged violations of the California Labor Code regarding: off-the-clock work, incorrect and untimely payment of wages, meal and rest periods, reimbursement of expenses, non-compliant wage statements, payment of final wages, incorrect rates for sick pay, meal and rest premiums and vacation\n\n59\n\n* * *\n\n[Table of Contents](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_7)\n\npay and reimbursement of expenses. Nader v. Costco (Case No. CV-24-006198; Stanislaus County Superior Court). The Company has not yet responded to the complaint.\n\nBeginning in December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous cases concerning the impacts of opioid abuses filed against various defendants by counties, cities, hospitals, Native American tribes, third-party payors, and others. In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (N.D. Ohio). Included are cases filed against the Company by counties and cities in Michigan, New Jersey, Oregon, Virginia and South Carolina, a third-party payor in Ohio, and a hospital in Texas, class actions filed on behalf of infants born with opioid-related medical conditions in 40 states, and class actions and individual actions filed on behalf of individuals seeking to recover alleged increased insurance costs associated with opioid abuse in 43 states and American Samoa. Claims against the Company filed in federal court outside the MDL have been asserted by certain counties and cities in Florida and Georgia; claims filed by certain cities and counties in New York are pending in state court. Claims against the Company in state courts in New Jersey, Oklahoma, Utah, and Arizona have been dismissed. The Company is defending all of the pending matters.\n\nIn October 2021 the Company received a notice that the Quebec Health Insurance Board had commenced an inquiry to determine whether the Company had given or received improper payments for drugs that are covered by the province's prescription drug program from drug wholesalers, generic drug manufacturers or the independent pharmacist who owns and operates the pharmacies located in the Company's Quebec locations. The inquiry covers a period beginning January 1, 2017. In August 2024 the Board made a demand of an immaterial amount.\n\nThe Company is a named defendant in four bodily injury actions relating to its sale of Real Water, an alkalized water previously sold at the Company and other retailers. Kaveh et al. v. Costco Wholesale Corp. et al., Case No. A23-864391-B, District Court, Clark County, NV Wei, et al. v. Costco Wholesale Corp. et al. Case No. A-22-856147-B, District Court, Clark County, NV Henry et al. v.

The plaintiffs allegedly sustained liver or other bodily damage as a result of consuming the product, and seek compensatory and punitive damages from all defendants, which include the manufacturer, distributors, testing equipment makers and retailers. The Kaveh case is set for trial on March 17, 2025. Wei and Henry have been consolidated with Brown. et al., vs. AffinityLifestyles.com, Inc., et al., Case No. A-21-831776-B, District Court, Clark County, NV. The Company is not a named defendant in Brown. Wei/Henry/Brown is set for trial starting October 7, 2024.\n\nBetween September 25, 2023, and October 31, 2023, five class action suits were filed against the Company alleging various privacy law violations stemming from pixel trackers on Costco.com: Birdwell v. Costco Wholesale Corp., Case No. T23-1405, Contra Costa County Superior Court; and Scott v. Costco Wholesale Corp., Case No. 2:23-cv-08808 (C.D. Cal.), now consolidated with R.S. v. Costco Wholesale Corp., Case No. 2:23-cv-01628 (W.D. Wash.); Groves, et ano. v. Costco Wholesale Corp., Case No. 2:23-cv-01662 (W.D. Wash.), and Castillo v. Costco Wholesale Corp., under Case No. 2:34-cv-01548 (W.D. Wash.). The Castillo plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint on January 26, 2024, which seeks damages, equitable relief and attorneys’ fees under various statutes, including the Washington Consumer Protection Act, Washington Privacy Act, Washington Uniform Health Care Information Act, Electronic Communications Privacy Act, California Invasion of Privacy Act, and California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act. The consolidated complaint also alleges breach of implied contract, invasion of privacy, conversion, and unjust enrichment. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the Castillo complaint on March 11, 2024. In Birdwell, the Company filed a motion to dismiss and demurrer on January 22, 2024. On May 5, 2024, the Birdwell Court granted the demurrer with leave to amend and requested additional briefing on whether the case should be stayed in favor of Castillo. On May 16, 2024, the parties stipulated to stay Birdwell pending resolution of Castillo. On January 2, and August 22, 2024, the Company received related civil investigative demands from the Washington Attorney General's Office. On January 3, 2024, the Company received a related pre-litigation letter from the Los Angeles Office of the County Counsel. The Company is in the process of responding to both agencies.\n\n60\n\n* * *\n\n[Table of Contents](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_7)\n\nOn June 20, 2024, a class action lawsuit was filed against the Company and Nice-Pak Products, Inc., alleging that Kirkland Signature Fragrance Free Baby Wipes contain 3.7 parts per billion of per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances. The complaint alleges that the label claim that the wipes are “made with naturally derived ingredients” thus violates various state consumer protection and false advertising laws. The complaint seeks unspecified damages, including punitive damages, as well as equitable relief and attorneys’ fees and costs. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss on August 9, 2024. Bullard, et ano., v. Costco Wholesale Corp., et ano., No. 3:24-cv-03714 (N.D. Cal.).\n\nIn January 2023 the Company received a Civil Investigative Demand from the U.S. Attorney's Office, Western District of Washington, requesting documents. The government is conducting a False Claims Act investigation concerning whether the Company presented or caused to be presented to the federal government for payment false claims relating to prescription medications.\n\nIn May 2024 the Company received a Notice of Intent to File Administrative Complaint for Violations of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA is seeking administrative fines for importation, sale and distribution of misbranded devices and unregistered products the government asserts are pesticides under FIFRA.\n\nThe Company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows; it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter or year.\n\n61\n\n* * *\n\n[Table of Contents](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_7)\n\nNote 11—Segment Reporting\n\nThe Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden.

The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, with assistance from other members of management, have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September\xa01, 2024, and, based on their evaluation, have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date.\n\nManagement's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and the dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness for future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nUnder the supervision of and with the participation of our management, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September\xa01, 2024, using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013).\n\nBased on its assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September\xa01, 2024. The attestation of KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is included with the consolidated financial statements in [Item 8](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_76) of this Report.\n\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n\n63\n\n* * *\n\n[Table of Contents](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_7)\n\nItem\xa09B—Other Information\n\nDuring the fiscal quarter ended September\xa01, 2024, no director or officer of the Company adopted or terminated a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.\n\nItem\xa09C—Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections\n\nNot Applicable.\n\nPART III\n\nItem\xa010—Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance\n\nInformation relating to the availability of our code of ethics for senior financial officers and a list of our executive officers appear in Part I, [Item\xa01](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm#ied98cc882e5d481daeb0d876006a17ac_16) of this Report.

ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K TABLE OF CONTENTS PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS GENERAL NIKE, Inc. was incorporated in 1967 under the laws of the State of Oregon. As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this "Annual Report"), the terms "we," "us," "our," "NIKE" and the "Company" refer to NIKE, Inc. and its predecessors, subsidiaries and affiliates, collectively, unless the context indicates otherwise. Our principal business activity is the design, development and worldwide marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services. NIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products through NIKE Direct operations, which are comprised of both NIKE-owned retail stores and sales through our digital platforms (also referred to as "NIKE Brand Digital") and to wholesale accounts, which include a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives in nearly all countries around the world. We also offer interactive consumer services and experiences through our digital platforms. Nearly all of our products are manufactured by independent contractors. Nearly all footwear and apparel products are manufactured outside the United States, while equipment products are manufactured both in the United States and abroad. All references to fiscal 2025, 2024, 2023, 2022 and 2021 are to NIKE, Inc.\'s fiscal years ended May 31, 2025, 2024, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Any references to other fiscal years refer to a fiscal year ending on May 31 of that year. PRODUCTS Our NIKE Brand product offerings are aligned around our consumer construct focused on Men\'s, Women\'s and Kids\'. We also design products specifically for the Jordan Brand and Converse. We believe this approach allows us to create products that better meet individual consumer needs while accelerating our largest growth opportunities. NIKE\'s athletic footwear products are designed primarily for specific athletic use, although a large percentage of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes. We place considerable emphasis on innovation and high-quality construction in the development and manufacturing of our products. We also sell sports apparel, which features the same trademarks and are sold predominantly through the same marketing and distribution channels as athletic footwear. Our sports apparel, similar to our athletic footwear products, is designed primarily for athletic use, although many of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes, and demonstrates our commitment to innovation and high-quality construction. We often market footwear, apparel and accessories in "collections" of similar use or by category. We also market apparel with licensed college and professional team and league logos. We sell a line of performance equipment and accessories under the NIKE Brand name, including bags, socks, sport balls, eyewear, timepieces, digital devices, bats, gloves, protective equipment and other equipment designed for sports activities. We also sell small amounts of various plastic products to other manufacturers through our wholly-owned subsidiary, NIKE IHM, Inc., doing business as Air Manufacturing Innovation. Our Jordan Brand designs, distributes and licenses athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories predominantly focused on basketball performance and culture using the Jumpman trademark. Sales and operating results for Jordan Brand products are reported within the respective NIKE Brand geographic operating segments. Our wholly-owned subsidiary brand, Converse, headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, designs, distributes and licenses casual sneakers, apparel and accessories under the Converse, Chuck Taylor, All Star, One Star, Star Chevron and Jack Purcell trademarks. Operating results of the Converse brand are reported on a stand-alone basis. In addition to the products we sell to our wholesale customers and directly to consumers through our NIKE Direct operations, we have also entered into license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture and sell, using NIKE-owned trademarks, certain apparel, digital devices and applications and other equipment designed for sports activities. We also offer interactive consumer services and experiences as well as digital products through our digital platforms, including fitness and activity apps; sport, fitness and wellness content; and digital services and features in retail stores that enhance the consumer experience. SALES AND MARKETING We experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary considerably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear, apparel and equipment, as well as other macroeconomic, strategic, operating and logistics-related factors. Because NIKE is a consumer products company, the relative popularity and availability of various sports and fitness activities, as well as changing design trends and consumer preferences, affect the demand for our products. We must, therefore, respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings and channels, developing new products, styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing. Failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability. This is a continuing risk. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors. OUR MARKETS We report our NIKE Brand operations based on our internal geographic organization.\xa0Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. The Company\'s reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America; Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa ("EMEA"); Greater China; and Asia Pacific &amp; Latin America ("APLA"), and include results for the NIKE and Jordan brands. Sales through our NIKE Direct operations are managed within each geographic operating segment. Converse is also a reportable operating segment and operates predominately in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of casual sneakers, apparel and accessories. Converse direct to consumer operations, including digital commerce, are reported within the Converse operating segment results. UNITED STATES MARKET For fiscal 2024, NIKE Brand and Converse sales in the United States accounted for approximately 42% of total revenues, compared to 43% and 40% for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively. We sell our products to thousands of wholesale accounts in the United States, including a mix of footwear stores, sporting goods stores, athletic specialty stores, department stores, skate, tennis and golf shops and other wholesale accounts. In the United States, we utilize NIKE sales offices to solicit such sales. During fiscal 2024, our three largest United States customers accounted for approximately 21% of sales in the United States. Our NIKE Direct and Converse direct to consumer operations sell our products to consumers through various digital platforms. In addition, our NIKE Direct and Converse direct to consumer operations sell products through the following number of retail stores in the United States: U.S. RETAIL STORES NUMBER NIKE Brand factory stores 211\xa0 NIKE Brand in-line stores (including employee-only stores) 85\xa0 Converse stores (including factory stores) 81\xa0 TOTAL 377 \xa0 In the United States, NIKE has eight significant distribution centers. Refer to Item 2. Properties for additional information. INTERNATIONAL MARKETS For fiscal 2024, non-U.S. NIKE Brand and Converse sales accounted for approximately 58% of total revenues, compared to 57% and 60% for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively. We sell our products through NIKE Direct operations and to wholesale accounts, which include a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives around the world. We sell to thousands of retail accounts and ship products from 68 distribution centers outside of the United States. Refer to Item 2. Properties for additional information on distribution facilities outside of the United States. During fiscal 2024, NIKE\'s three largest customers outside of the United States accounted for approximately 15% of total non-U.S.\xa0sales. In addition to NIKE-owned and Converse-owned digital commerce platforms in over 40 countries, our NIKE Direct and Converse direct to consumer businesses operate the following number of retail stores outside the United States: NON-U.S. RETAIL STORES NUMBER NIKE Brand factory stores 561\xa0 NIKE Brand in-line stores (including employee-only stores) 53\xa0 Converse stores (including factory stores) 54\xa0 TOTAL 668 \xa0 SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER No customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated net Revenues during fiscal 2024. PRODUCT RESEARCH, DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT We believe our research, design and development efforts are key factors in our success. Technical innovation in the design and manufacturing process of footwear, apparel and athletic equipment receives continued emphasis as we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance, reduce injury and maximize comfort, while decreasing our environmental impact. In addition to our own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics, chemistry, exercise physiology, engineering, digital technologies, industrial design, sustainability and related fields, we also utilize research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes, coaches, trainers, equipment managers, orthopedists, podiatrists, physicians and other experts who consult with us and review certain designs, materials and concepts for product and manufacturing, design and other process improvements and compliance with product safety regulations around the world. Employee athletes, athletes engaged under sports marketing contracts and other athletes wear-test and evaluate products during the design and development process. As we continue to develop new technologies, we are simultaneously focused on the design of innovative products and experiences incorporating such technologies throughout our product categories and consumer applications. Using market intelligence and research, our various design teams identify opportunities to leverage new technologies in existing categories to respond to consumer preferences. The proliferation of Nike Air, Zoom, Free, Dri-FIT, Flyknit, FlyEase, ZoomX, Air Max, and React technologies, among others, typifies our dedication to designing innovative products. MANUFACTURING Nearly all of our footwear and apparel products are manufactured outside the United States by independent contract manufacturers ("contract manufacturers"), many of which operate multiple factories. We are also supplied, primarily indirectly, by a number of materials, or "Tier 2" suppliers, who provide the principal materials used in footwear and apparel finished goods products. As of May\xa031, 2024, we had 169 strategic Tier 2 suppliers. As of May\xa031, 2024, our contract manufacturers operated 96 finished goods footwear factories located in 11 countries. For fiscal 2024, NIKE Brand footwear finished goods were manufactured by 15 contract manufacturers, many of which operate multiple factories. The largest single finished goods footwear factory accounted for approximately 9% of total fiscal 2024 NIKE Brand footwear production. For fiscal 2024, factories in Vietnam, Indonesia and China manufactured approximately 50%, 27% and 18% of total NIKE Brand footwear, respectively. For fiscal 2024, four footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10% of footwear production and in the aggregate accounted for approximately 57% of NIKE Brand footwear production. As of May\xa031, 2024, our contract manufacturers operated 285 finished goods apparel factories located in 33 countries. For fiscal 2024, NIKE Brand apparel finished goods were manufactured by 68 contract manufacturers, many of which operate multiple factories. The largest single finished goods apparel factory accounted for approximately 9% of total fiscal 2024 NIKE Brand apparel production. For fiscal 2024, factories in Vietnam, China and Cambodia manufactured approximately 28%, 16% and 15% of total NIKE Brand apparel, respectively. For fiscal 2024, one apparel contract manufacturer accounted for more than 10% of apparel production, and the top five contract manufacturers in the aggregate accounted for approximately 51% of NIKE Brand apparel production. NIKE\'s contract manufacturers buy raw materials for the manufacturing of our footwear, apparel and equipment products. Most raw materials are available and purchased by those contract manufacturers in the countries where manufacturing takes place. The principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, natural and synthetic leather, nylon, polyester and natural fiber textiles, as well as polyurethane films used to make NIKE Air-Sole cushioning components. During fiscal 2024, Air Manufacturing Innovation, a wholly-owned subsidiary, with facilities near Beaverton, Oregon, in Dong Nai Province, Vietnam, and St. Charles, Missouri, as well as contract manufacturers in China and Vietnam, were our suppliers of NIKE Air-Sole and other cushioning components used in footwear. The principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics, yarns and threads (both virgin and recycled); specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body, retain heat and repel rain and/or snow; and plastic and metal hardware. From time to time, certain materials used in the production of our products experience periods of high demand, shortages and price volatility. In fiscal 2024, contract manufacturers were able to source sufficient quantities of raw materials for use in our footwear and apparel products. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors, for additional discussion of the impact of sourcing risks on our business. Since 1972, Sojitz Corporation of America ("Sojitz America"), a large Japanese trading company and the sole owner of our redeemable preferred stock, has performed import-export financing services for us. INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TRADE Our international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad, such as the implementation of, or potential changes in, foreign and domestic trade policies, increases in import duties, anti-dumping measures, quotas, safeguard measures, trade restrictions, restrictions on the transfer of funds and, in certain parts of the world, political tensions, instability, conflicts, nationalism and terrorism, and resulting sanctions and other measures imposed in response to such issues. We have not, to date, been materially affected by any such risk but cannot predict the likelihood of such material effects occurring in the future. In recent years, uncertain global and regional economic and political conditions have affected international trade and increased protectionist actions around the world.\xa0These trends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors, and the footwear and apparel industries, as a whole, are not immune. Companies in our industry are facing trade protectionism in many different regions, and, in nearly all cases, we are working together with industry groups to address trade issues and reduce the impact to the industry, while observing applicable competition laws. Notwithstanding our efforts, protectionist measures have resulted in increases in the cost of our products, and additional measures, if implemented, could adversely affect sales and/or profitability for NIKE, as well as the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole. We monitor protectionist trends and developments throughout the world that may materially impact our industry, and we engage in administrative and judicial processes to mitigate trade restrictions. We are actively monitoring actions that may result in additional anti-dumping measures and could affect our industry. We are also monitoring for and advocating against other impediments that may limit or delay customs clearance for imports of footwear, apparel and equipment. NIKE also advocates for trade liberalization for footwear and apparel in a number of bilateral and multilateral free trade agreements. Changes in, and responses to, U.S. trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs or penalties on imported goods or retaliatory measures by other countries, have negatively affected, and could in the future negatively affect, U.S. corporations, including NIKE, with business operations and/or consumer markets in those countries, which could also make it necessary for us to change the way we conduct business, either of which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or our results of operations. In addition, with respect to proposed trade restrictions, we work with a broad coalition of global businesses and trade associations representing a wide variety of sectors to help ensure that any legislation enacted and implemented (i)\xa0addresses legitimate and core concerns, (ii)\xa0is consistent with international trade rules and (iii)\xa0reflects and considers domestic economies and the important role they may play in the global economic community. Where trade protection measures are implemented, we believe we have the ability to develop, over a period of time, adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained from our present suppliers. If events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country, our operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact. However, we believe we could abate any such disruption, and that much of the adverse impact on supply would, therefore, be of a short-term nature, although alternate sources of supply might not be as cost-effective and could have an ongoing adverse impact on profitability. Our international operations are also subject to compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the "FCPA"), and other anti-bribery laws applicable to our operations. We source a significant portion of our products from, and have important consumer markets, outside of the United States. We have an ethics and compliance program to address compliance with the FCPA and similar laws by us, our employees, agents, suppliers and other partners. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information on risks relating to our international operations. COMPETITION The athletic footwear, apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive on a worldwide basis. We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies, athletic and leisure apparel companies, sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear, apparel and equipment, including adidas, Anta, ASICS, Deckers, Li Ning, lululemon athletica, New Balance, On, Puma, Under Armour and V.F. Corporation, among others. The intense competition and the rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant risk factors in our operations. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information. NIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. Important aspects of competition in this industry are: • Product attributes such as quality; innovation and development; performance and reliability; new product style, and design; as well as consumer price/value. • Consumer connection, engagement and affinity for brands and products, developed through marketing, promotion and digital experiences; social media interaction; customer support and service; identification with prominent and influential athletes, influencers, public figures, coaches, teams, colleges and sports leagues who endorse our brands and use our products and active engagement through sponsored sporting events and clinics. • Effective sourcing and distribution of products, with attractive merchandising and presentation at retail, both in-store and on digital platforms. We believe that we are competitive in all of these areas. See Item 1A. Risk Factors, including the risk factor titled "Our products, services and experiences face intense competition." TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS We believe that our intellectual property rights are important to our brand, our success and our competitive position. We strategically pursue available protections of these rights and vigorously protect and enforce them against third-party theft and infringement. We use trademarks on nearly all of our products and packaging, and in our marketing materials, and believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods, in identifying our brands and the Company, and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others. We consider our NIKE and Swoosh Design trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in over 190 jurisdictions worldwide. In addition, we own many other trademarks that we use in marketing our products. Throughout the world, we own common law rights in the trade dress of several distinctive shoe designs and elements. For certain trade dress, we have sought and obtained trademark registrations. We have copyright protection in our designs, graphics, software applications, digital goods and other original works. When appropriate, we also obtain registered copyrights. We file for, own and maintain many U.S. and foreign utility and design patents protecting components, technologies, materials, manufacturing techniques, features, functionality, and industrial designs used in and for the manufacture of various athletic, performance, and leisure footwear and apparel, including physical and digital versions thereof, athletic equipment, and digital devices, and related software applications. These patents expire at various times. We believe our success depends upon our capabilities in areas such as design, research and development, production and marketing and is supported and protected by our intellectual property rights, such as trademarks, utility and design patents, copyrights, and trade secrets, among others. We have followed a policy of applying for and registering intellectual property rights in the United\xa0States and select foreign countries on trademarks, inventions, innovations and designs that we deem protectable and valuable. We also continue to vigorously protect and enforce our intellectual property, including trademarks, patents and trade secrets against third-party infringement and misappropriation. HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES At NIKE, we consider the strength and effective management of our workforce to be essential to the ongoing success of our business. We believe that it is important to attract, develop and retain a diverse and engaged workforce at all levels of our business and that such a workforce fosters creativity and accelerates innovation. We are focused on building a talent pipeline that reflects our consumers, athletes and the communities we serve. CULTURE Each employee shapes NIKE\'s culture through behaviors and practices. This starts with our Maxims, which represent our core values and, along with our Code of Conduct, feature the fundamental behaviors that help anchor, inform and guide us and apply to all employees. Our mission is to bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world, which includes the belief that if you have a body, you are an athlete. We aim to do this by creating groundbreaking sport innovations, making our products more sustainably, building a creative and diverse global team, supporting the well-being of our employees and making a positive impact in communities where we live and work. Our mission is aligned with our deep commitment to maintaining an environment where all NIKE employees have the opportunity to reach their full potential, to connect to our brands and to shape our workplace culture. We believe providing for growth and retention of our employees is essential in fostering such a culture and are dedicated to providing access to training programs and career development opportunities, including trainings on NIKE\'s values, history and business, trainings on developing leadership skills at all levels, tools and resources for managers and qualified tuition reimbursement opportunities. In empowering our employees to help shape our culture, we source employee feedback through a variety of survey tools: our annual Engagement Survey program, corporate pulse surveys and listening sessions. These tools provide employees throughout the globe an opportunity to provide confidential feedback on key areas known to drive employee engagement, including their satisfaction with their managers, their work and the Company generally. These tools also measure our employees\' connection to NIKE\'s culture. NIKE also provides multiple points of contact for employees to speak up if they experience something that does not align with our values or otherwise violates our workplace policies, even if they are uncertain what they observed or heard is a violation of company policy. As part of our commitment to making a positive impact on our communities, we maintain a goal of investing 2% of our prior fiscal year\'s pre-tax income into global communities. The focus of this investment continues to be inspiring youth to be active through play and sport as well as uniting and inspiring communities to create a better and more equitable future for all. Our community investments are an important part of our culture, and we support employees in giving back to community organizations through volunteering and donations, which are matched by the NIKE Foundation where eligible. EMPLOYEE BASE As of May\xa031, 2024, we had approximately 79,400 employees worldwide, including retail and part-time employees. We also utilize independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce. Most of our employees are not represented by unions, except for certain employees in the EMEA and APLA geographies who are members of and/or represented by trade unions, as allowed or required by local law and/or collective bargaining agreements. Also, in some countries outside of the United States, local laws require employee representation by works councils (which may be entitled to information and consultation on certain subsidiary decisions) or by organizations similar to a union. In certain European countries, we are required by local law to enter into, and/or comply with, industry-wide or national collective bargaining agreements. NIKE has never experienced a material interruption of operations due to labor disagreements. DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION Diversity, equity and inclusion ("DE&amp;I") is a strategic priority for NIKE and we are committed to having an inclusive and diverse team and culture. We aim to foster an inclusive and accessible workplace through recruitment, development and retention of talent from diverse experiences and backgrounds with the goal of expanding representation across all dimensions of diversity over the long term. We remain committed to the targets announced in fiscal 2021 for the Company to work toward by fiscal 2025, including diverse representation in our corporate workforce and leadership positions. We continue our efforts to recruit talent through our traditional channels and through initiatives, such as partnerships with athletes and sports-related organizations to create apprenticeship programs and new partnerships with organizations, colleges and universities that serve diverse populations. Additionally, we are prioritizing DE&amp;I education so that all NIKE employees and leaders have the cultural knowledge and understanding to lead inclusively and build diverse and inclusive teams. We also have Employee Networks, collectively known as NikeUNITED, representing various employee groups. Our DE&amp;I focus extends beyond our workforce and includes our communities, which we support in a number of ways. We have committed to investments that aim to address racial inequality and improve diversity and representation in our communities. We also are leveraging our global scale to support business diversity among the businesses with which we work. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS NIKE\'s total rewards are intended to be competitive and equitable, meet the diverse needs of our global teammates and reinforce our values. We are committed to providing comprehensive, competitive and equitable pay and benefits to our employees, and we have invested, and aim to continue to invest, in our employees through growth and development and holistic well-being initiatives. Our initiatives in this area include: • We are committed to competitive pay, pay equity and to reviewing our pay and promotion practices annually. • We have an annual company bonus plan and a retail-focused bonus plan applicable to all eligible employees.

RISK FACTORS Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Analyst Reports Certain written and oral statements, other than purely historic information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to NIKE\'s business plans, objectives and expected operating or financial results and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, made or incorporated by reference from time to time by NIKE or its representatives in this Annual Report, other reports, filings with the SEC, press releases, conferences or otherwise, are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Section\xa021E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate or imply future results, performance or achievements, and may contain the words "believe," "anticipate," "expect," "estimate," "project," "will be," "will continue," "will likely result" or words or phrases of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time in reports filed by NIKE with the SEC, including reports filed on Forms 8-K, 10-Q and 10-K, and include, among others, the following: risks relating to our multi-year enterprise initiative, including the risk that NIKE is not able to identify opportunities to deliver anticipated cost savings, risks related to any delays in the timing for implementing the initiative or potential disruptions to NIKE\'s business or operations as it executes on the initiative, and other factors that may cause NIKE to be unable to achieve the expected benefits of the initiative; intense competition among designers, marketers, distributors and sellers of athletic or leisure footwear, apparel and equipment for consumers and endorsers; NIKE\'s ability to successfully innovate and compete in various categories; new product development and innovation; demographic changes; changes in consumer preferences and channel mix; popularity of particular designs, categories of products and sports; seasonal and geographic demand for NIKE products; difficulties in anticipating or forecasting, and responding to changes in consumer preferences, consumer demand for NIKE products, changes in channel mix and the various market factors described above; the size and growth of the overall athletic or leisure footwear, apparel and equipment markets; international, national and local political, civil, economic and market conditions, including high and increasing inflation and interest rates; our ability to execute on our sustainability strategy and achieve our sustainability-related goals and targets, including sustainable product offerings; difficulties in implementing, operating and maintaining NIKE\'s increasingly complex information technology systems and controls, including, without limitation, the systems related to demand and supply planning and inventory control; interruptions in data and information technology systems; consumer data security; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results, including, without limitation, the fact that advance orders may not be indicative of future revenues due to changes in shipment timing, the changing mix of orders with shorter lead times, and discounts, order cancellations and returns; the ability of NIKE to sustain, manage or forecast its growth and inventories; the size, timing and mix of purchases of NIKE\'s products; increases in the cost of materials, labor and energy used to manufacture products; the ability to secure and protect trademarks, patents and other intellectual property; product performance and quality; customer service; adverse publicity and an inability to maintain NIKE\'s reputation and brand image, including without limitation, through social media or in connection with brand damaging events; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; dependence on distributors and licensees; business disruptions; increased costs of freight and transportation to meet delivery deadlines; increases in borrowing costs due to any decline in NIKE\'s debt ratings; changes in business strategy or development plans; general risks associated with doing business outside of the United States, including, without limitation, exchange rate fluctuations, inflation, import duties, tariffs, quotas, sanctions, political and economic instability, conflicts and terrorism; the potential impact of new and existing laws, regulations or policy, including, without limitation, tariffs, import/export, trade, wage and hour or labor and immigration regulations or policies; changes in government regulations; the impact of, including business and legal developments relating to, climate change, extreme weather conditions and natural disasters; litigation, regulatory proceedings, sanctions or any other claims asserted against NIKE; the ability to attract and retain qualified employees, and any negative public perception with respect to key personnel or our corporate culture, values or purpose; the effects of NIKE\'s decision to invest in or divest of businesses or capabilities; health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks; and other factors referenced or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report and other reports. Investors should also be aware that while NIKE does, from time to time, communicate with securities analysts, it is against NIKE\'s policy to disclose to them any material non-public information or other confidential commercial information. Accordingly, shareholders should not assume that NIKE agrees with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report. Furthermore, NIKE has a policy against confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others. Thus, to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections, forecasts or opinions, such reports are not the responsibility of NIKE. Risk Factors The risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this Annual Report may include additional factors which could adversely affect NIKE\'s business and financial performance. Moreover, NIKE operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risks, nor can it assess the impact of all such risks on NIKE\'s business or the extent to which any risk, or combination of risks, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Economic and Industry Risks Global economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. The uncertain state of the global economy, including sustained high levels of inflation and interest rates and the risk of a recession, continues to impact businesses around the world. If global economic and financial market conditions deteriorate, the following factors, among others, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition: • Our sales are impacted by discretionary spending by consumers. Declines in consumer spending have in the past resulted in and may in the future result in reduced demand for our products, increased inventories, reduced orders from retailers for our products, order cancellations, lower revenues, higher discounts and lower gross margins. • In the future, we may be unable to access financing in the credit and capital markets at reasonable rates in the event we find it desirable to do so. • We conduct transactions in various currencies, which creates exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar.\xa0Continued volatility in the markets and exchange rates for foreign currencies and contracts in foreign currencies has had and could continue to have a significant impact on our reported operating results and financial condition. • Continued volatility in the availability and prices for commodities and raw materials we use in our products and in our supply chain (such as cotton or petroleum derivatives) has had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our costs, gross margins and profitability. In addition, supply chain issues caused by factors including geopolitical conflicts and pandemics have impacted and may in the future impact the availability, pricing and timing for obtaining commodities and raw materials. • If retailers of our products experience declining revenues or experience difficulty obtaining financing to purchase our products, this could result in reduced orders for our products, order cancellations, late retailer payments, extended payment terms, higher accounts receivable, reduced cash flows, greater expense associated with collection efforts and increased bad debt expense. • In the past, certain retailers of our products have experienced severe financial difficulty, become insolvent and ceased business operations, and this could occur in the future, which could negatively impact the sale of our products to consumers. • If contract manufacturers of our products or other participants in our supply chain experience difficulty obtaining financing to purchase raw materials or to finance capital equipment and other general working capital needs, it may result in delays or non-delivery of shipments of our products. Our products, services and experiences face intense competition. NIKE is a consumer products company and the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products, services and experiences. The athletic footwear, apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive both in the United States and worldwide. We compete with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies, athletic and leisure apparel companies, sports equipment companies, private label brands offered by major retailers and various other large companies that have diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear, apparel and equipment. New competitors frequently enter the markets we serve. We also compete with other companies for the production capacity of contract manufacturers that produce our products. In addition, we and our contract manufacturers compete with other companies and industries for raw materials used in our products. Our NIKE Direct operations, both through our digital commerce operations and retail stores, also compete with multi-brand retailers, which sell our products through their digital platforms and physical stores, and with digital commerce platforms. In addition, we compete with respect to the digital services and experiences we are able to offer our consumers, including fitness and activity apps; sport, fitness and wellness content and services; and digital services and features in retail stores that enhance the consumer experience. Product offerings, product innovations and technologies, marketing expenditures (including expenditures for advertising and endorsements), pricing, costs of production, customer service, digital commerce platforms, digital services and experiences and social media presence are areas of intense competition. These, in addition to ongoing rapid changes in technology (including marketing and advertising technology), a reduction in barriers to starting new footwear and apparel companies and an increase in the number of such companies (some of which may be able to react more nimbly to changes in consumer preferences) and changes in consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear, apparel, and equipment, services and experiences, constitute significant risk factors in our operations. In addition, the competitive nature of retail, including shifts in the ways in which consumers shop, constitutes a risk factor implicating our NIKE Direct and wholesale operations. If we do not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competitors, our costs may increase, demand for our products may decline, possibly significantly, or we may need to reduce wholesale or suggested retail prices for our products. Economic factors beyond our control, and changes in the global economic environment, including fluctuations in inflation and currency exchange rates, could result in lower revenues, higher costs and decreased margins and earnings. A majority of our products are manufactured and sold outside of the United States, and we conduct purchase and sale transactions in various currencies, which creates exposure to the volatility of global economic conditions, including fluctuations in inflation and foreign currency exchange rates. Central banks deploy various strategies to combat inflation, including increasing interest rates, which impact our borrowing costs. Government shutdowns or the risk of government shutdowns, as well as the impact or expected impact of elections, both in the United States and in other countries around the world, may also increase volatility. Additionally, there has been, and may continue to be, volatility in currency exchange rates that impact the U.S. Dollar value relative to other international currencies. Our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies, and these revenues and expenses are affected by currency fluctuations, specifically amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into U.S. Dollars for consolidated financial reporting, as weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar adversely affects the U.S. Dollar value of the Company\'s foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings. Currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance. Foreign currency fluctuations have adversely affected and could continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay, but not to completely eliminate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial results. Since the hedging activities are designed to lessen volatility, they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger U.S.\xa0Dollar or other trading currency, but they also reduce the positive impact of a weaker U.S. Dollar or other trading currency. Our future financial results have in the past been and could in the future be significantly affected by the value of the U.S.\xa0Dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business. The degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities. We may be adversely affected by the financial health of our wholesale customers. We extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customer\'s financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. To assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of our products, we offer certain customers the opportunity to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our futures ordering program. These advance orders may be canceled under certain conditions, and the risk of cancellation increases when dealing with financially unstable retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty. In the past, some customers have experienced financial difficulties up to and including bankruptcies, which have had an adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition. When the retail economy weakens or as consumer behavior shifts, retailers tend to be more cautious with orders. A slowing or changing economy in our key markets, including a recession, could adversely affect the financial health of our customers, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, product sales are dependent in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing retail environment to attract consumers, which requires continuing investments by retailers. Retailers that experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them, resulting in lower sales and orders for our products. Climate change and other sustainability-related matters, or legal, regulatory or market responses thereto, may have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. There are concerns that increased levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have caused, and may continue to cause, potentially at a growing rate, increases in global temperatures, changes in weather patterns and increasingly frequent and/or prolonged extreme weather and climate events. Climate change may also exacerbate challenges relating to the availability and quality of water and raw materials, including those used in the production of our products, and may result in changes in regulations or consumer preferences, which could in turn affect our business, operating results and financial condition. For example, there has been increased focus by governmental and non-governmental organizations, consumers, customers, employees and other stakeholders on products that are sustainably made and other sustainability matters, including responsible sourcing and deforestation, the use of plastic, energy and water, the recyclability or recoverability of packaging and materials transparency, any of which may require us to incur increased costs for additional transparency, due diligence and reporting. In addition, federal, state or local governmental authorities in various countries are implementing, have proposed and are likely to continue to propose, legislative and regulatory initiatives to reduce or mitigate the impacts of climate change on the environment. Various countries and regions are following different approaches to the regulation of climate change, which could increase the complexity of, and potential cost related to complying with, such regulations. Any of the foregoing may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment, may impact the availability and cost of key raw materials used in the production of our products or the demand for our products, and, in turn, may adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition. Investors, regulators and other stakeholders are also increasingly scrutinizing companies’ environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) commitments, performance and disclosures, including related to climate change, and in recent years have placed increasing importance on social costs and related implications of their investments. Additionally, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their respective approaches to ESG matters, which are increasingly being employed by investors, lenders, and customers to inform their investment, financing or purchasing decisions. Although we have announced sustainability-related goals and targets, there can be no assurance that our stakeholders will agree with our strategies, and any perception, whether or not valid, that we have failed to achieve, or to act responsibly with respect to, such matters or to effectively respond to new or additional legal or regulatory requirements regarding climate change, could result in adverse publicity and adversely affect our business and reputation. Execution of these strategies and achievement of our goals is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, our ability to execute our strategies and achieve our goals within the currently projected costs and the expected timeframes; the availability and cost of raw materials and renewable energy; unforeseen production, design, operational and technological difficulties; the outcome of research efforts and future technology developments, including the ability to scale projects and technologies on a commercially competitive basis such as carbon sequestration and/or other related processes; compliance with, and changes or additions to, global and regional regulations, taxes, charges, mandates or requirements relating to greenhouse gas emissions, carbon costs or climate-related goals; adapting products to customer preferences and customer acceptance of sustainable supply chain solutions; and the actions of competitors and competitive pressures. As a result, there is no assurance that we will be able to adequately meet stakeholder expectations, successfully execute our strategies or achieve our sustainability-related goals, which could damage our reputation and customer and other stakeholder relationships and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Extreme weather conditions and natural disasters could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition. Given the broad and global scope of our operations, we are particularly vulnerable to the physical risks of climate change, such as shifts in weather patterns. Extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our retail stores, suppliers, manufacturers, customers, distribution centers, offices, headquarters and vendors are located could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Moreover, natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, wildfires, tsunamis, floods or droughts, whether occurring in the United States or abroad, and their related consequences and effects, including energy shortages and public health issues, have in the past temporarily disrupted, and could in the future disrupt, our operations, the operations of our vendors, manufacturers and other suppliers or have in the past resulted in, and in the future could result in, economic instability that may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition. In particular, if a natural disaster or severe weather event were to occur in an area in which we or our suppliers, manufacturers, employees, customers, distribution centers or vendors are located, our continued success would depend, in part, on the safety and availability of the relevant personnel and facilities and proper functioning of our or third parties\' computer, network, telecommunication and other systems and operations. In addition, a natural disaster or severe weather event could negatively impact retail traffic to our stores or stores that carry our products and could have an adverse impact on consumer spending, any of which could in turn result in negative point-of-sale trends for our merchandise. Further, climate change may increase both the frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions and natural disasters, which may affect our business operations, either in a particular region or globally, as well as the activities of our third-party vendors and other suppliers, manufacturers and customers. The diversity of locations in which we operate, our operational size, disaster recovery and business continuity planning and our information technology systems and networks, including the Internet and third-party services ("Information Technology Systems"), may not be sufficient for all or for concurrent eventualities. If we were to experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity event or concurrent events, we could experience operational challenges, in particular depending upon how a local or regional event may affect our human capital across our operations or with regard to particular aspects of our operations, such as key executive officers or personnel. For example, our World Headquarters is located in a seismic zone, which is at a higher risk for earthquakes and the related consequences or effects. Further, if we are unable to find alternative suppliers, replace capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations or quickly repair damage to our Information Technology Systems or supply systems, we could be late in delivering, or be unable to deliver, products to our customers. These events could result in reputational damage, lost sales, cancellation charges or markdowns, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our financial condition and results of operations have been, and could in the future be, adversely affected by a pandemic, epidemic or other public health emergency. Pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and other public health emergencies, and preventative measures taken to contain or mitigate such crises have caused, and may in the future cause, business slowdown or shutdown in affected areas and significant disruption in the financial markets, both globally and in the United States. These events have led to and could again lead to adverse impacts to our global supply chain, factory cancellation costs, store closures, and a decline in retail traffic and discretionary spending by consumers and, in turn, materially impact our business, sales, financial condition and results of operations as well as cause a volatile effective tax rate driven by changes in the mix of earnings across our jurisdictions. We cannot predict whether, and to what degree, our sales, operations and financial results could in the future be affected by the pandemic and preventative measures. Risks presented by pandemics and other public health emergencies include, but are not limited to: • Deterioration in economic conditions in the United States and globally, including the effect of prolonged periods of inflation on our consumers and vendors; • Disruption to our distribution centers, contract manufacturers, finished goods factories and other vendors, through the effects of facility closures, increased operating costs, reductions in operating hours, labor shortages, and real time changes in operating procedures, such as additional cleaning and disinfection procedures, which have had, and could in the future again have, a significant impact on our planned inventory production and distribution, including higher inventory levels or inventory shortages in various markets; • Impacts to our distribution and logistics providers\' ability to operate, including labor and container shortages, and increases in their operating costs. These supply chain effects have had, and could in the future have, an adverse effect on our ability to meet consumer demand, including digital demand, and have in the past resulted in and could in the future result in extended inventory transit times and an increase in our costs of production and distribution, including increased freight and logistics costs and other expenses; • Decreased retail traffic as a result of store closures, reduced operating hours, social distancing restrictions and/or changes in consumer behavior; • Reduced consumer demand for our products, including as a result of a rise in unemployment rates, higher costs of borrowing, inflation and diminished consumer confidence; • Cancellation or postponement of sports seasons and sporting events in multiple countries, and bans on large public gatherings, which have reduced and in the future could reduce consumer spending on our products and could impact the effectiveness of our arrangements with key endorsers; • The risk that any safety protocols in NIKE-owned or affiliated facilities, including our offices, will not be effective or not be perceived as effective, or that any virus-related illnesses will be linked or alleged to be linked to such facilities, whether accurate or not; • Incremental costs resulting from the adoption of preventative measures and compliance with regulatory requirements, including providing facial coverings and hand sanitizer, rearranging operations to follow social distancing protocols, conducting temperature checks, testing and undertaking regular and thorough disinfecting of surfaces; • Bankruptcies or other financial difficulties facing our wholesale customers, which could cause them to be unable to make or delay making payments to us, or result in revised payment terms, cancellation or reduction of their orders; and • Significant disruption of and volatility in global financial markets, which could have a negative impact on our ability to access capital in the future. We cannot reasonably predict the ultimate impact of any pandemic or public health emergency, including the extent of any adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition, which will depend on, among other things, the duration and spread of the pandemic or public health emergency, the impact of governmental regulations that have been, and may continue to be, imposed in response, the effectiveness of actions taken to contain or mitigate the outbreak, the availability, safety and efficacy of vaccines, including against emerging variants of the infectious disease, and global economic conditions. Additionally, disruptions have in the past made it more challenging to compare our performance, including our revenue growth and overall profitability, across quarters and fiscal years, and could have this effect in the future. Any pandemic or public health emergency may also affect our business, results of operations or financial condition in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks and may also exacerbate, or occur concurrently with, other risks discussed in this Item 1A. Risk Factors, any of which could have a material effect on us. Business and Operational Risks Failure to maintain our reputation, brand image and culture could negatively impact our business. Our iconic brands have worldwide recognition, and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation. Maintaining, promoting and growing our brands will depend on our design and marketing efforts, including product innovation, product quality and advertising and consumer campaigns. Our commitment to product innovation, quality and sustainability, and our continuing investment in design (including materials), marketing and sustainability measures may not have the desired impact on our brand image and reputation. In addition, our success in maintaining, extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media and digital environment, including our reliance on social media, digital advertising networks, digital and advertising technology, and digital dissemination of advertising campaigns on our digital platforms and through our digital experiences and products. We could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives. Our brand value also depends on our ability to maintain a positive consumer perception of our corporate integrity, purpose and brand culture. Negative claims or publicity involving us, our culture and values, our products, services and experiences, consumer data, or any of our key employees, endorsers, sponsors, suppliers or partners could seriously damage our reputation and brand image, regardless of whether such claims are accurate. For example, while we require our suppliers of our products to operate their business in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we do not control their practices. Negative publicity relating to a violation or an alleged violation of policies or laws by such suppliers could damage our brand image and diminish consumer trust in our brand. Further, our reputation and brand image could be damaged as a result of our support of, association with or lack of support or disapproval of certain social causes and public personalities, as well as any decisions we make to continue to conduct, or change, certain of our activities in response to such considerations. Social media, which accelerates and potentially amplifies the scope of negative publicity, can increase the challenges of responding to negative claims. Adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us, or by us, could also damage our reputation and brand image, undermine consumer confidence in us and reduce long-term demand for our products, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations. If the reputation, culture or image of any of our brands is tarnished or if we receive negative publicity, then our sales, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products, we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenues and profits. Our success depends on our ability to identify, originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate, gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner so that our product offerings evolve and are responsive to consumer demands. However, lead times for many of our products make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing product trends or consumer preferences. All of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. Our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of products or away from these types of products altogether, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. If we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing new products, designs, styles and categories, and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing, we could experience lower sales, excess inventories or lower profit margins, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we market our products globally through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs and campaigns, including social media and other digital advertising networks. If we do not successfully market our products, if advertising and promotional costs increase or if certain advertising networks are no longer available, these factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We rely on technical innovation and high-quality products to compete. Technical innovation and quality control in the design and manufacturing processes of footwear, apparel, equipment and other products and services are essential to the commercial success of our products and development of new products. Research and development play a key role in technical innovation. We rely upon specialists in the fields of biomechanics, chemistry, exercise physiology, engineering, digital technologies, industrial design, sustainability and related fields, as well as research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes, coaches, trainers, equipment managers, orthopedists, podiatrists and other experts to develop and test cutting-edge performance products. While we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance and reduce injury and maximize comfort, if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products, consumer demand for our products could decline, and if we experience problems with the quality of our products (including the introduction of bias or inaccuracies in our products), we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems and loss of consumer confidence. Our enterprise initiative may not generate the intended benefits or projected cost savings we anticipate. In December 2023, we announced a multi-year enterprise initiative aimed at delivering cost savings and investing in future growth, accelerating innovation and driving profitability. Areas of potential savings include simplifying our product assortment, increasing automation and use of technology, streamlining our organization and leveraging our scale to drive greater efficiency. Our ability to achieve the intended cost savings and goals associated with the enterprise initiative are subject to many estimates and assumptions, which may change during implementation and execution. For example, we may not be able to identify opportunities to deliver anticipated cost savings. Additionally, the timing of the cost savings associated with the enterprise initiative may be delayed. Further, we may also face disruptions to our business or operations as we execute on the initiative. Our business is affected by seasonality, which could result in fluctuations in our operating results. We experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time or in the future as a result of strategic shifts in our business and seasonal or geographic demand for particular types of footwear, apparel and equipment and in connection with the timing of significant sporting events, such as the NBA Finals, Olympics or the World Cup, among others. In addition, our customers may, and from time to time do, cancel orders, change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice. As a result, we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales. Accordingly, our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period. This seasonality, along with other factors that are beyond our control, including economic conditions, changes in consumer preferences, weather conditions, outbreaks of disease, social or political unrest, availability of import quotas, transportation disruptions and currency exchange rate fluctuations, has in the past adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate. Our operating margins are also sensitive to a number of additional factors that are beyond our control, including manufacturing and transportation costs, shifts in product sales mix and geographic sales trends, all of which we expect to continue. Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period. Failure to continue to obtain or maintain high-quality endorsers of our products could harm our business. We establish relationships with professional athletes, sports teams and leagues, as well as other public figures, including artists, designers and influencers, to develop, evaluate and promote our products, as well as establish product authenticity with consumers. However, as competition in our industry has increased, the costs associated with establishing and retaining such sponsorships and other relationships have increased, and competition to attract and retain high-quality endorsers has increased. If we are unable to negotiate new, or maintain our current, associations with professional athletes, sports teams and leagues, or other public figures, or to do so at a reasonable cost, we could lose the high visibility or on-field authenticity associated with our products, and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments. As a result, our brands, net revenues, expenses and profitability could be harmed. Furthermore, if certain endorsers were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement agreements, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, actions taken or statements made by athletes, teams or leagues, or other endorsers, associated with our products or brand that harm the reputations of those athletes, teams or leagues, or endorsers, or our decisions to cease collaborating with certain endorsers in light of actions taken or statements made by them, have in the past harmed and could in the future seriously harm our brand image with consumers and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition. Poor or non-performance by our endorsers, a failure to continue to correctly identify promising athletes, public figures or sports organizations, to use and endorse our products and brand or a failure to enter into cost-effective endorsement arrangements with prominent athletes, public figures and sports organizations could adversely affect our brand, sales and profitability. Failure to accurately forecast consumer demand could lead to excess inventories or inventory shortages, which could result in decreased operating margins, reduced cash flows and harm to our business. To meet anticipated demand for our products, we purchase products from manufacturers outside of our futures ordering program and in advance of customer orders, which we hold in inventory and resell to customers. There is a risk we may be unable to sell excess products ordered from manufacturers. Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs, and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply products we require at the time we need them, we may experience inventory shortages. Inventory shortages could delay shipments to customers, negatively impact retailer, distributor and consumer relationships and diminish brand loyalty. The difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows from period to period. A failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our net revenues and net income, and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance. Our NIKE Direct operations have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. Our NIKE Direct operations, including our retail stores and digital platforms, have required and will continue to require significant investment. Our NIKE Direct stores have required and will continue to require substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements and personnel. We have entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and marketing activities and to integrate with our digital platforms. Because of their unique design and technological elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than other stores. Due to the high fixed-cost structure associated with our NIKE Direct retail stores, a decline in sales, a shift in consumer behavior away from brick-and-mortar retail, or the closure, temporary or otherwise, or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and employee-related costs. Many factors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond our control, pose risks and uncertainties. Risks include, but are not limited to: credit card fraud and theft in both our retail stores and on digital platforms; mismanagement of existing retail channel partners; inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation; and supply chain and inventory management. In addition, we have made significant investments in digital technologies and information systems for the digital aspect of our NIKE Direct operations, and our digital offerings will require co ntinued investment in the development and upgrading of our technology platforms. In order to deliver high-quality digital experiences, our digital platforms must be designed effectively and work well with a range of other technologies, systems, networks, and standards that we do not control. We may not be successful in developing platforms that operate effectively with these technologies, systems, networks or standards. A growing portion of consumers access our NIKE Direct digital platforms, but in the event that it is more difficult for consumers to access and use our digital platforms, consumers find that our digital platforms do not effectively meet their needs or expectations or consumers choose not to access or use our digital platforms or use devices that do not offer access to our platforms, the success of our NIKE Direct operations could be adversely impacted. Our competitors may develop, or have already developed, digital experiences, features, content, services or technologies that are similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance.\xa0 We may not realize a satisfactory return on our investment in our NIKE Direct operations and management\'s attention from our other business opportunities could be diverted, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If the technology-based systems, applications and platforms that give our consumers the ability to shop or interact with us online do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as our ability to grow our digital commerce business globally or to retain our customer base, could be materially adversely affected. Many of our consumers shop with us through our digital platforms. Consumers frequently use mobile-based devices and applications to shop online with us and with our competitors, and to do comparison shopping, as well as to engage with us and our competitors through digital services and experiences that are offered on mobile platforms. We use social media and proprietary mobile applications to interact with our consumers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. Any failure on our part to provide attractive, effective, reliable, secure and user-friendly digital commerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise with rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers or any failure to provide attractive digital experiences to our customers could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of digital commerce and other sales, harm our reputation with consumers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our digital commerce business globally and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. In addition, as use of our digital platforms continues to grow, we will need an increasing amount of technical infrastructure to continue to satisfy our consumers\' needs. If we fail to continue to effectively scale and adapt our digital platforms to accommodate increased consumer demand, our business may be subject to interruptions, delays or failures and consumer demand for our products and digital experiences could decline. Risks specific to our digital commerce business also include diversion of sales from our and our retailers\' brick and mortar stores, pricing pressure on our products, difficulty in recreating the in-store experience through direct channels and liability for online content. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in our digital commerce business, as well as damage our reputation and brands. We rely significantly on information technology to operate our business, including our supply chain and retail operations, and any failure, inadequacy or interruption of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business. We are heavily dependent on Information Technology Systems, across our supply chain, including product desig', url='https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320187/000032018724000044/nke-20240531.htm')][0m

The White House cited "China\'s non-market overcapacity in steel and aluminum, which are among the world\'s most carbon intensive."\n\n\\\\* Semiconductors: Tariffs will increase from 25% to 50% by 2025, the White House said, citing China\'s huge share in new semiconductor wafers coming online and a spike in prices during the pandemic. "China\'s policies in the legacy semiconductor sector have led to growing market share and rapid capacity expansion that risks driving out investment by market-driven firms."\n\n\\\\* Electric Vehicles: Tariffs will increase from 25% to 100% in 2024 (on top of a separate 2.5% tariff), the White House said, citing "extensive subsidies and non-market practices leading to substantial risks of overcapacity." The U.S. Trade Representative\'s Office said plug-in hybrid electric vehicles will be covered by the new tariffs but not hybrid vehicles.\n\n\\\\* Batteries, Battery Components and Parts: Tariffs on lithium-ion EV batteries will increase from 7.5% to 25% in 2024, while the tariff rate on lithium-ion non-EV batteries will increase from 7.5% to 25% in 2026. Tariff rates on battery parts will increase from 7.5% to 25% in 2024\n\n\\\\* Critical minerals: Tariffs for certain critical minerals will increase from 0 to 25% in 2024.\n\nMinerals covered by the new tariffs include: Manganese ores and concentrates including ferruginous manganese ores & concentrates with manganese content over 20% calculated on dry weight; Cobalt ores and concentrates; Aluminum ores and concentrates; Zinc ores and concentrates; Chromium ores and concentrates; Tungsten concentrates, oxides, carbide, powders and Tungstates (wolframates); Tritium and its compounds, alloys, dispersions, ceramic products and mixtures thereof; Actinium, Californium, Curium, Einsteinium, Gadolinium, Polonium, Radium, Uranium & their compounds, alloys, dispersions, ceramic products & mixtures; Other radioactive elements, isotopes, compounds; alloys, dispersions, ceramic products and mixtures; Radioactive residues; Ferronickel; Ferroniobium containing by weight less than 0.02% of phosphorus or sulfur or less than 0.4% of silicon; Zinc (other than alloy), unwrought, containing o/99.99% by weight of zinc; Zinc (o/than alloy); Zinc alloy, unwrought; Tin o/than alloy), unwrought; Tin alloy, unwrought; Tantalum, unwrought; tantalum powders; Chromium, unwrought; chromium powders; Indium, unwrought; indium powders\n\n\\\\* Natural graphite and permanent magnets for EV batteries: Tariffs will increase from 0% to 25% in 2026; tariffs for certain other critical minerals will also increase from 0% to 25% in 2024.\n\n\\\\* Solar cells: Tariffs on cells - whether assembled into modules or not - will double to 50% in 2024 to "protect against China’s policy-driven overcapacity that depresses prices and inhibits the development of solar capacity outside of China."\n\n\\\\* Ship-to-shore cranes: New tariffs of 25% will be added in 2024 to "help protect U.S. manufacturers from China\'s unfair trade practices that have led to excessive concentration in the market."\n\n\\\\* Medical Products Syringes and needles: New tariffs of 50% will be imposed in 2024; tariffs for certain personal protective equipment (PPE), including some respirators and face masks, will increase from the current range of 0 to 7.5% to 25% in 2024. Tariffs on rubber medical and surgical gloves will increase from 7.5% to 25% in 2026 to "help support and sustain a strong domestic industrial base for medical supplies that were essential to the COVID-19 pandemic response."\n\n## PROPOSED EXCLUSIONS\n\nThe U.S. Trade Representative\'s (USTR) office said it has proposed exclusions from the tariffs on over 330 categories of industrial machinery to aid U.S. manufacturers, including producers of solar panels.\n\nThe list, contained in a lengthy USTR review of its Section 301 tariffs, includes 19 categories of equipment used to manufacture solar panels, including silicon crystal growth furnaces, and soldering and lamination machines. USTR said these exclusions will encourage domestic manufacturing of solar products.\n\nOther broad categories for industrial exclusions include:\n\n\\\\* Hydraulic and mechanical metal presses, machine tools for working metal and stone, metal rolling mills.\n\n\\\\* Offshore oil and gas drilling and production platforms, boring and rock cutting machinery.\n\n\\\\* Agricultural equipment including seeders, planters, fertilizer distributors.\n\n\\\\* Brewery and bakery equipment, machinery for preparation of meat and poultry.\n\n\\\\* Textile machinery including spinning and knitting machines, looms and sewing machines.\n\n\\\\* Molding machines for rubber and plastics, industrial furnaces for making printed circuit assemblies.\n\nReporting by David Shepardson and David Lawder; Editing by Heather Timmons, Dan Burns, Sonali Paul and Ros Russell\n\nOur Standards: [The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tab](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html)\n\nShare\n\n- X\n\n- Facebook\n\n- Linkedin\n\n- Email\n\n- Link\n\n\n[Purchase Licensing Rights](https://www.reutersagency.com/en/licensereuterscontent/?utm_medium=rcom-article-media&utm_campaign=rcom-rcp-lead)\n\n## Read Next\n\n- [Technologycategory](https://www.reuters.com/technology/) [Start Campus plans to invest $9.35 billion in Portugal data hub](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/start-campus-plans-invest-935-billion-portugal-data-hub-2025-04-04/) 11:12 AM UTC\n\n- [Climate & Energycategory](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/) [Africa\'s top climate negotiator says \'no reverse gear\' on commitments](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/cop/africas-top-climate-negotiator-says-no-reverse-gear-commitments-2025-04-04/) 9:23 AM UTC\n\n- [Climate & Energycategory](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/) [French onshore wind power project halted by court](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/french-onshore-wind-power-project-halted-by-court-2025-04-04/) 8:51 AM UTC\n\n- [category](https://www.reuters.com/markets/) [Indian delegation to visit Chile seeking stake in SQM\'s lithium projects, source says](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/indian-delegation-visit-chile-seeking-stake-sqms-lithium-projects-source-says-2025-04-04/) 8:02 AM UTC\n\n\n## [World](https://www.reuters.com/world/)\n\n- ### [Hard-right candidate leads field as new Romania election campaign begins](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/hard-right-candidate-leads-field-new-romania-election-campaign-begins-2025-04-04/)\n\n[Europecategory](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/) · April 4, 2025 · 1:24 PM UTC · ago\n\nRomanian presidential candidates began campaigning on Friday for the rerun of an election canceled over accusations of Russian meddling, with Romania\'s role in NATO and the EU and its aid to neighbouring Ukraine in the spotlight.\n\n- [Middle Eastcategory](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/) [Israeli troops expand \'security zone\' in northern Gaza](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-troops-expand-security-zone-northern-gaza-2025-04-04/) 1:22 PM UTC · Updated ago\n\n- [Worldcategory](https://www.reuters.com/world/) [Which countries are quitting a key landmine treaty and why?](https://www.reuters.com/world/which-countries-are-quitting-key-landmine-treaty-why-2025-04-04/) 1:20 PM UTC · Updated ago\n\n- [Worldcategory](https://www.reuters.com/world/) [Sanctioned Russia escapes immediate US tariff hit, braces for long-term impact](https://www.reuters.com/world/kremlin-says-russia-must-guard-against-world-market-turbulence-after-trump-2025-04-04/) 1:18 PM UTC · Updated ago\n\n- [Middle Eastcategory](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/) [Exclusive: Turkey wants no confrontation with Israel in Syria, foreign minister says](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkey-wants-no-confrontation-with-israel-syria-foreign-minister-says-2025-04-04/) 1:17 PM UTC · Updated ago', url='https://www.reuters.com/world/what-are-bidens-new-tariffs-china-goods-2024-05-14/'), ExaOutput(text='Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[US-China relations](https://www.scmp.com/topics/us-china-relations)\n\n\\+ FOLLOW\n\nGet more with _my_ NEWS\n\nA personalised news feed of stories that matter to you\n\n[Learn more](https://www.scmp.com/mynews?module=myNEWS_text&pgtype=article)\n\n![](https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/768x768/public/d8/images/canvas/2024/01/17/f9e52ba2-f8c8-401e-8e82-3c060fe3df7a_1b6695e6.jpg?itok=KSlaJ2bX&v=1705446415)\n\nChinese cars await loading aboard a cargo ship at the port in Yantai, Shandong province on January 2, 2024.

Trade issues remain contentious between the two nations. Photo: AFP/Getty Images/TNS\n\nImposed since the Donald Trump administration, average US tariffs on imports from China remain elevated at 19.3 per cent. The US also has 247 anti-dumping and countervailing duty measures in place against Chinese goods, including steel, chemicals, machinery and automobiles, Kennedy added.\n\nTo retaliate, China attached additional tariffs on certain US goods. And the issue remains a friction point between the two nations.\n\nWilliam Reinsch, a chair in international business at CSIS, said, though, that a lengthy legislative process and lack of consensus in the US Congress could delay final enactment of any potential new tariffs.\n\n“It’s going to take longer than 2024 to get there, because it’s a process issue,” Reinsch said. “And the process is not short.”\n\nHistorically, passing significant legislation tends to be difficult in an election year, but tough-on-China bills could be the exception, given bipartisan wariness towards Beijing.\n\nSo far, there has been no broad national consensus on increasing tariffs against China, and the idea is unpopular with the US business community, which has sought to remove the Trump-era tariffs.\n\nStill, any announcement of trade bills or import duties investigations would have a chilling effect on bilateral trade and investment, Reinsch added.\n\nIn 2023, China’s exports to the US suffered their deepest decline in almost three decades, falling by 13.1 per cent compared to a year earlier to US$500.3 billion, according to China customs data.\n\nThe panellists noted that while the US and its allies share rising economic and security concerns towards Beijing, it remains very challenging to take joint actions. Many US allies, they noted, do not have not much interest in a broader decoupling with China.\n\n“One of the risks that the US runs – if it heads in that direction \\[of decoupling\\] – is getting out of step with its trading partners around the world and ending up isolating itself,” Kennedy said.\n\n![](https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/04/20/Explainer_thu_clean.jpg?itok=HZykIMRq)\n\n14:45\n\nAn unwinnable conflict? The US-China trade war, 5 years on\n\nAn unwinnable conflict? The US-China trade war, 5 years on\n\nWhile semiconductors and critical minerals are already contested areas, electric vehicles might emerge as a new focus dominating US-China economic competition this year, said Ilaria Mazzocco, a chair in Chinese business and economics at CSIS.\n\n“The debate is not necessarily going to be just about EV imports into the United States, which of course are not particularly significant at this time,” she said.\n\n“It’s going to be about future imports. More importantly, it’s going to be about the whole value chain.”\n\nWhen all the data is tabulated, China is set to have surpassed Japan as the world’s leading exporter of automobiles in 2023, with major destinations spanning from Europe to Southeast Asia.\n\nBut a stiff 27.5 per cent tariff – in place since Trump’s presidency – along with US President Joe Biden’s signature legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act, that provides subsidies for domestic electric vehicle manufacturers, have largely kept Chinese EVs at bay in the US market.\n\nStill, US reliance on imports of Chinese-made lithium batteries has continued to rise in recent years. In the first 11 months of 2023, China’s share of US total lithium battery imports was more than 70 per cent, according to South China Morning Post calculations based on US census data.\n\n“In EVs, there’s a fundamental question about whether China’s going to be part of the solution or they’re just the entire problem,” Kennedy said.\n\n“I think it’s going to be hard for the US to make its energy transition, particularly in transportation, without having some amount of Chinese participation – particularly in batteries.”\n\n![](https://assets-v2.i-scmp.com/production/_next/static/media/wheel-on-gray.af4a55f9.gif)\n\n4', url='https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3248691/us-tariffs-chinese-imports-might-increase-2024-analysts-say'), ExaOutput(text="Accessibility links\n\n- [Skip to main content](https://www.npr.org/2023/06/19/1183040910/tariffs-the-trump-administration-imposed-on-chinese-imports-are-still-in-place#mainContent)\n- [Keyboard shortcuts for audio player](https://help.npr.org/contact/s/article?name=what-are-the-keyboard-shortcuts-for-using-the-npr-org-audio-player)\n\n**Tariffs the Trump administration imposed on Chinese imports are still in place** **President Biden has held on to one of the signature economic policies of his predecessor: tariffs on imports from China.

We look at why he's kept them, and what it means for businesses.\n\nLEILA FADEL, HOST:\n\nThere are big issues between Washington and Beijing on trade.\n\nA MARTÍNEZ, HOST:\n\nYeah. When he was president, Donald Trump launched a trade war with China, eventually slapping tariffs on more than $300 billion worth of imports. And 2 1/2 years into the Biden presidency, those tariffs are under review but have not yet changed.\n\nFADEL: NPR White House correspondent Asma Khalid talked to both Trump and Biden's top trade officials about this, and she joins us now. Good morning.\n\nASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Good morning, Leila.\n\nFADEL: So, Asma, let's go back in time first. Why were these tariffs put on China to begin with?\n\nKHALID: Well, for years, businesses had been complaining that China was not playing fairly - that they subsidized their companies, they didn't respect intellectual property rights and even forced American companies, in some cases, to turn over their tech secrets. And so Donald Trump came in and basically turned the traditional free trade norm on its head. His top trade person during this time period was a man named Bob Lighthizer. And we spoke on the phone the other day. He told me that the U.S. relationship with China, he believed, had to fundamentally change.\n\nROBERT LIGHTHIZER: We can't keep transferring hundreds of billions of dollars every year to somebody who's trying to harm us and take our jobs and steal our technology and threaten our military and the like.\n\nKHALID: So the Trump administration turned to tariffs, which, I will say, at the time, was extremely controversial - a 25% tariff on Chinese imports. Lots of everyday items that Americans rely on from China were taxed. I mean, you think underwear, coats, utensils. There were also tariffs on a bunch of obscure parts that are used by American manufacturers. To be clear, many critics will say these are taxes, and these are taxes that are paid by American businesses and American consumers, not the Chinese.\n\nFADEL: Now, I remember all the warnings about how this would affect prices and competition. And when Biden took over, what did he do with them?\n\nKHALID: Yeah, I mean, to your point, there was a lot of criticism. I will say, Democrats piled on Trump. They said that he was haphazard in the way that he launched this fight with China. One of the things that intrigues me, really, about Joe Biden is that he talks a lot about making things in America. I'm sure you've heard him highlight the subsidies that his government is offering to lure factories back from overseas.\n\nFADEL: Right.\n\nKHALID: But he's not out there talking about these tariffs, and yet, he has kept them in place. His team is currently reviewing them. And I asked Biden's top trade official, Katherine Tai, what is going on with this review? You know, are you going to lift any of the tariffs? And she said something that I thought was rather telling.\n\nKATHERINE TAI: One key question that's really important for us to consider is, what has China done in these last few years that would merit our changing this tariff structure?\n\nKHALID: She told me there are real issues with the way that China trades, and those issues have not gone away. She also said that overall, she's looking at how the U.S. can break what she called an addiction to just chasing the lowest price for everything, no matter the cost. I should add that tariff review I mentioned is expected to wrap up later this year. But, of course, then we head into a presidential election year, and these tariffs were Donald Trump's signature policy, and he is the current Republican front-runner.\n\nFADEL: Asma, what about the businesses that pay these tariffs? What are they saying about the review?\n\nKHALID: Well, there are definitely U.S. companies that appreciate these tariffs, and I interviewed some. But there are also business owners who are really frustrated with the climate. They had hoped that Joe Biden and his team would have changed some aspects of the tariff policy by now. I went out to Minnesota to a company called MISCO. They make sound speakers, and a lot of their parts come from China. The company's CEO, Dan Digre, told me he feels like a pawn in this big geopolitical game, and he thinks any conversation about rescinding these tariffs will be seen as being weak on China. And so as the presidential election cycle heats up, he is not optimistic that things will change.\n\nFADEL: NPR White House correspondent Asma Khalid.

REUTERS/Brian Snyder/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tab Companies BEIJING, May 13 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden is set to announce new China tariffs as soon as Tuesday, targeting sectors including electric vehicles, medical supplies and solar equipment, according to people familiar with the matter. The expected move by the Biden administration comes ahead of the November presidential election. Biden, a Democrat seeking re-election, has taken a tough-on-China approach that would maintain existing tariffs on many Chinese goods set by former President Donald Trump, his expected Republican challenger. Sign up here. The impact on Chinese industries, however, is expected to be limited. DOES CHINA EXPORT EVS TO THE UNITED STATES? Very few. In the first quarter, Geely (GEELY.UL) was the only Chinese automaker to export to the United States with 2,217 cars, according to data from the China Passenger Car Association. Geely, which has sold some EVs in the U.S. market under its Polestar brand, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. China\'s Geely and Sweden\'s Volvo Cars (VOLCARb.ST), opens new tab founded EV maker Polestar Automotive, which makes most of its cars in China. Volvo is majority-owned by Geely. Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath told Reuters last month the company is accelerating efforts to produce more vehicles outside China. Polestar aims for a sales breakdown of 40% in Europe, 30% in the United States and 30% in the Asia-Pacific region, he said. Ingenlath told Reuters last year that Polestar will start production in South Carolina for U.S. and European markets from 2024. ARE NEW TARIFFS A THREAT TO CHINA\'S SOLAR INDUSTRY? The market is small for China and exports to the United States have been subject to tariffs for more than a decade. Further duties were also recently imposed on several Chinese solar panel makers who finished their panels in Southeast Asia. Over 80% of solar panel manufacturing now takes place in China, and the cost of making a panel in China is 60% cheaper than in the U.S., according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. Last year, China exported $3.35 million solar cells to the U.S., less than 0.1% of China\'s total exports. Outbound shipments of completed solar panels to the U.S. stood at $13.15 million in 2023, only 0.03% of China\'s solar panel exports. Industry observers said the equipment to produce solar panels involves a complicated supply chain. How the new U.S. tariffs affect sales of that equipment will depend on the details of the U.S. trade levy, they said. WHAT ABOUT MEDICAL SUPPLIES? Chinese-made medical supplies such as syringes and personal protective equipment also face additional U.S. tariffs, sources familiar with the decision said. According to WTO data, China exported $30.9 billion medical goods to the United States in 2022, accounting for about one fifth of China\'s overall exports of medical goods. The expected tariffs are part of the Biden administration\'s broader strategy to protect the U.S. against supply shortages seen during the pandemic that left hospitals scrambling to find critical equipment, the sources said. In December, the United States Trade Representative announced a further extension of China-related "Section 301" tariff exclusions until May 31. The American Medical Manufacturers Association has called for these exclusions to be revoked, arguing they are no longer needed to deal with a COVID-19 emergency. The association says American manufacturers need the chance to compete with imports on a more level playing field. MORE TARIFFS ON METAL PRODUCTS? Biden in April also called for tripling U.S. tariffs on Chinese metal products. That would apply to more than $1 billion worth of steel and aluminium products, a U.S. official said.

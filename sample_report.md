## Definition & Core Concept 
This section will cover the basic concept of tariffs, their types, and how they are calculated. Tariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods and services, and their implementation is based on economic theories and legal frameworks [1]. The current tariffs imposed by the United States are no exception, with a base tax of 10% in place across the world, in addition to duties on some industries. 
## Scientific Basis 
The current status of American tariffs is complex and has undergone significant changes. Tariffs are often used as a tool to protect domestic industries and to generate revenue for the government. However, they can also have negative effects on consumer demand and the overall economy [2]. The legal framework of tariffs is based on international trade agreements and executive orders. The United States has imposed sweeping tariffs on its trading partners, including China, Mexico, and Canada [3]. However, some of these tariffs have been paused or delayed, such as the tariffs on Mexico and Canada, which were delayed for 90 days to negotiate trade deals. 
## Real-World Applications
 The United States has been involved in a series of trade wars and tariff implementations in recent years. This section will delve into the current status of American tariffs, their effects on domestic and international trade, and the industries most affected [4]. As of April 2025, there have been several developments in American tariffs. For instance, reciprocal tariffs with countries like Bosnia and Herzegovina and Botswana have been delayed until July 9, with rates of 36% and 38% respectively on all products, excluding certain exceptions [5].
